Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools. ​ Why MCP? MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides: A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure ​ General architecture At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers: MCP Hosts : Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP MCP Clients : Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers MCP Servers : Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol Local Data Sources : Your computer’s files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access Remote Services : External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to ​ Get started Choose the path that best fits your needs: ​ Quick Starts For Server Developers Get started building your own server to use in Claude for Desktop and other
clients For Client Developers Get started building your own client that can integrate with all MCP servers For Claude Desktop Users Get started using pre-built servers in Claude for Desktop ​ Examples Example Servers Check out our gallery of official MCP servers and implementations Example Clients View the list of clients that support MCP integrations ​ Tutorials Building MCP with LLMs Learn how to use LLMs like Claude to speed up your MCP development Debugging Guide Learn how to effectively debug MCP servers and integrations MCP Inspector Test and inspect your MCP servers with our interactive debugging tool MCP Workshop (Video, 2hr) ​ Explore MCP Dive deeper into MCP’s core concepts and capabilities: Core architecture Understand how MCP connects clients, servers, and LLMs Resources Expose data and content from your servers to LLMs Prompts Create reusable prompt templates and workflows Tools Enable LLMs to perform actions through your server Sampling Let your servers request completions from LLMs Transports Learn about MCP’s communication mechanism ​ Contributing Want to contribute?

Thai Cobra Scorpion Whiskey, often referred to as “Snake Whiskey,” is a type of spirit found in Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand and Vietnam. This whiskey is notable for containing either a whole snake, scorpion, or both, in the bottle. The snakes are often venomous, like cobras, and the belief is that their venom is neutralized by the ethanol in the whiskey. While none of these claims have been tested and verified by BarWarriors, thousands of sailors and marines have tasted this beast and survived. Table of Contents The Tradition and History How Did They Get The Cobra In The Bottle? The Making of Cobra Whiskey Medicinal Claims and Cultural Significance Controversies and Concerns The Tradition and History While it’s often referred to as “Snake Wine,” “Snake Whiskey,” and “Cobra Whiskey,” there isn’t a traditional name for the spirit. It’s known solely by descriptive terms. And in another weird twist, despite the liquor commonly infusing a whole snake in the bottle, using a cobra isn’t a requirement. In fact, medicinal liquors of this type usually feature a variety of regional animals and insects. This tradition of infusing alcohol with animals or insects dates back centuries in Asia. These practices are often rooted in traditional medicine systems, like Traditional Chinese Medicine and similar local practices in Vietnam and Thailand. In many Asian cultures, snakes are seen as powerful and potent creatures. The belief is that the essence and characteristics of these animals is infused into the liquor, imparting both flavor and therapeutic properties. By infusing the snake, it’s a way of harnessing its power. It also serves as a symbol of bravery and fearlessness. How Did They Get The Cobra In The Bottle? The Making of Cobra Whiskey The making of Cobra Whiskey involves a process that’s as intriguing as the drink itself. Here’s an overview of how it’s typically made: Selection of the Snake and/or Scorpion: The snakes used are usually venomous, such as cobras, while the scorpions are typically large and potent. They are chosen based on local beliefs about the medicinal properties they possess. The animals are often farmed or captured specifically for this purpose. Neutralization of the Venom: The venom of these creatures is protein-based, which means it’s rendered inactive by the ethanol in the whiskey—we’ve never been so happy to drink ethanol in our lives! This supposedly makes the drink safe to consume, as the venom is no longer poisonous after this process. Preparation of the Snake or Scorpion: The snake or scorpion is often killed just before the preparation. Then they are sometimes sewn or positioned into a threatening pose (like a cobra with its hood expanded) before being placed in the bottle. This is partly for the visual effect and to adhere to the belief that the animal’s strength and characteristics are transferred to the drink. Insertion into the Bottle: The snake or scorpion is then inserted into the bottle. For larger bottles, this is relatively straightforward, but with smaller bottles, this can require skill and sometimes involves dislocating or bending the snake to fit. Infusion: The bottle is then filled with whiskey or rice wine. The spirit used is typically a strong, clear grain alcohol, which is necessary to preserve the snake or scorpion and to ensure the venom is neutralized. Additional Ingredients: Sometimes herbs, spices, or other medicinal ingredients are added to the whiskey to enhance its flavor and its supposed health benefits. Aging: The whiskey is then left to ferment from several months to many years. During this time, it is believed that the essence and the supposed medicinal and virility-enhancing properties of the snake or scorpion infuse into the liquor. Medicinal Claims and Cultural Significance Cobra whiskey is said to possess various health benefits according to traditional beliefs. These include: Enhancing Virility: It’s often believed to act as an aphrodisiac and improve sexual performance. Some people who drink it experience numbing in their, er, extremities. Boosting Vitality: The whiskey is thought to imbue the drinker with the cobra’s strength and agility. Pain Relief: Some claim it can relieve different forms of pain and aches. Curing Hair Loss: In some traditions, it’s thought to promote hair growth or prevent hair loss. Improving Vision: There are claims that it can enhance eyesight, drawing a parallel to the keen vision of snakes.
