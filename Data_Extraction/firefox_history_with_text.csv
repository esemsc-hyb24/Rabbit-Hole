Navigation User Guide Introduction User Guide Introduction Quickstart Concepts Examples Tutorials FAQs Protocol Specification Key Changes Architecture Base Protocol Client Features Server Features Development Versioning Roadmap Contributing SDKs C# SDK Java SDK Kotlin SDK Python SDK Ruby SDK Swift SDK TypeScript SDK User Guide Copy page Introduction Get started with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools. ​ Why MCP? MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides: A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure ​ General architecture At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers: MCP Hosts : Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP MCP Clients : Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers MCP Servers : Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol Local Data Sources : Your computer’s files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access Remote Services : External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to ​ Get started Choose the path that best fits your needs: ​ Quick Starts For Server Developers Get started building your own server to use in Claude for Desktop and other
clients For Client Developers Get started building your own client that can integrate with all MCP servers For Claude Desktop Users Get started using pre-built servers in Claude for Desktop ​ Examples Example Servers Check out our gallery of official MCP servers and implementations Example Clients View the list of clients that support MCP integrations ​ Tutorials Building MCP with LLMs Learn how to use LLMs like Claude to speed up your MCP development Debugging Guide Learn how to effectively debug MCP servers and integrations MCP Inspector Test and inspect your MCP servers with our interactive debugging tool MCP Workshop (Video, 2hr) ​ Explore MCP Dive deeper into MCP’s core concepts and capabilities: Core architecture Understand how MCP connects clients, servers, and LLMs Resources Expose data and content from your servers to LLMs Prompts Create reusable prompt templates and workflows Tools Enable LLMs to perform actions through your server Sampling Let your servers request completions from LLMs Transports Learn about MCP’s communication mechanism ​ Contributing Want to contribute? Check out our Contributing Guide to learn how you can help improve MCP. ​ Support and Feedback Here’s how to get help or provide feedback: For bug reports and feature requests related to the MCP specification, SDKs, or documentation (open source), please create a GitHub issue For discussions or Q&A about the MCP specification, use the specification discussions For discussions or Q&A about other MCP open source components, use the organization discussions For bug reports, feature requests, and questions related to Claude.app and claude.ai’s MCP integration, please see Anthropic’s guide on How to Get Support Was this page helpful?

Thai Cobra Scorpion Whiskey, often referred to as “Snake Whiskey,” is a type of spirit found in Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand and Vietnam. This whiskey is notable for containing either a whole snake, scorpion, or both, in the bottle. The snakes are often venomous, like cobras, and the belief is that their venom is neutralized by the ethanol in the whiskey. While none of these claims have been tested and verified by BarWarriors, thousands of sailors and marines have tasted this beast and survived. Table of Contents The Tradition and History How Did They Get The Cobra In The Bottle? The Making of Cobra Whiskey Medicinal Claims and Cultural Significance Controversies and Concerns The Tradition and History While it’s often referred to as “Snake Wine,” “Snake Whiskey,” and “Cobra Whiskey,” there isn’t a traditional name for the spirit. It’s known solely by descriptive terms. And in another weird twist, despite the liquor commonly infusing a whole snake in the bottle, using a cobra isn’t a requirement. In fact, medicinal liquors of this type usually feature a variety of regional animals and insects. This tradition of infusing alcohol with animals or insects dates back centuries in Asia. These practices are often rooted in traditional medicine systems, like Traditional Chinese Medicine and similar local practices in Vietnam and Thailand. In many Asian cultures, snakes are seen as powerful and potent creatures. The belief is that the essence and characteristics of these animals is infused into the liquor, imparting both flavor and therapeutic properties. By infusing the snake, it’s a way of harnessing its power. It also serves as a symbol of bravery and fearlessness. How Did They Get The Cobra In The Bottle? The Making of Cobra Whiskey The making of Cobra Whiskey involves a process that’s as intriguing as the drink itself. Here’s an overview of how it’s typically made: Selection of the Snake and/or Scorpion: The snakes used are usually venomous, such as cobras, while the scorpions are typically large and potent. They are chosen based on local beliefs about the medicinal properties they possess. The animals are often farmed or captured specifically for this purpose. Neutralization of the Venom: The venom of these creatures is protein-based, which means it’s rendered inactive by the ethanol in the whiskey—we’ve never been so happy to drink ethanol in our lives! This supposedly makes the drink safe to consume, as the venom is no longer poisonous after this process. Preparation of the Snake or Scorpion: The snake or scorpion is often killed just before the preparation. Then they are sometimes sewn or positioned into a threatening pose (like a cobra with its hood expanded) before being placed in the bottle. This is partly for the visual effect and to adhere to the belief that the animal’s strength and characteristics are transferred to the drink. Insertion into the Bottle: The snake or scorpion is then inserted into the bottle. For larger bottles, this is relatively straightforward, but with smaller bottles, this can require skill and sometimes involves dislocating or bending the snake to fit. Infusion: The bottle is then filled with whiskey or rice wine. The spirit used is typically a strong, clear grain alcohol, which is necessary to preserve the snake or scorpion and to ensure the venom is neutralized. Additional Ingredients: Sometimes herbs, spices, or other medicinal ingredients are added to the whiskey to enhance its flavor and its supposed health benefits. Aging: The whiskey is then left to ferment from several months to many years. During this time, it is believed that the essence and the supposed medicinal and virility-enhancing properties of the snake or scorpion infuse into the liquor. Medicinal Claims and Cultural Significance Cobra whiskey is said to possess various health benefits according to traditional beliefs. These include: Enhancing Virility: It’s often believed to act as an aphrodisiac and improve sexual performance. Some people who drink it experience numbing in their, er, extremities. Boosting Vitality: The whiskey is thought to imbue the drinker with the cobra’s strength and agility. Pain Relief: Some claim it can relieve different forms of pain and aches. Curing Hair Loss: In some traditions, it’s thought to promote hair growth or prevent hair loss. Improving Vision: There are claims that it can enhance eyesight, drawing a parallel to the keen vision of snakes. Controversies and Concerns It’s important to approach Snake or Scorpion Whiskey with caution, especially considering the potential health risks and the ethical considerations regarding "

It is a national project initiated by the ruling royal dynasty whose layout was created by the German architect Hermann Tilke. With ten turns and four straights, it offers drivers several overtaking possibilities. Small drawback, the sand! He reigns supreme in the region and disrupts the smooth running of the cars. For the 2010 edition, the organizers are adding a winding section called ""Endurance"" which extends the circuit by almost a kilometer.

What's the delay between live events and API updates? Is there a query timeout? Community and Support Roadmap Contributing Contributors Usage Guidelines Acknowledgments br-g/openf1 @brgodefroy Buy me a coffee Contact |  Made in Paris, France Introduction OpenF1 is an open-source API that provides real-time and historical Formula 1 data. The API offers a wealth of information, including lap timings, car telemetry, radio communications, and more. Whether you're looking to create interactive dashboards, dive deep into race analysis, or even develop connected objects that light up every time your favorite driver takes the lead, OpenF1 makes it all possible. Historical data is freely accessible and requires no authentication. Real-time data access, however, requires a paid account—apply by filling out this form . Data can be accessed in either JSON or CSV formats, making it user-friendly for both developers and non-developers alike.
For a quick start, you can access the API through your web browser. A sample URL is provided for each endpoint for easy reference.

The API offers a wealth of information, including lap timings, car telemetry, radio communications, and more. Whether you're looking to create interactive dashboards, dive deep into race analysis, or even develop connected objects that light up every time your favorite driver takes the lead, OpenF1 makes it all possible. Historical data is freely accessible and requires no authentication. Real-time data access, however, requires a paid account—apply by filling out this form .

What's the delay between live events and API updates? Is there a query timeout? Community and Support Roadmap Contributing Contributors Usage Guidelines Acknowledgments br-g/openf1 @brgodefroy Buy me a coffee Contact |  Made in Paris, France Introduction OpenF1 is an open-source API that provides real-time and historical Formula 1 data. The API offers a wealth of information, including lap timings, car telemetry, radio communications, and more. Whether you're looking to create interactive dashboards, dive deep into race analysis, or even develop connected objects that light up every time your favorite driver takes the lead, OpenF1 makes it all possible. Historical data is freely accessible and requires no authentication. Real-time data access, however, requires a paid account—apply by filling out this form . Data can be accessed in either JSON or CSV formats, making it user-friendly for both developers and non-developers alike.
For a quick start, you can access the API through your web browser. A sample URL is provided for each endpoint for easy reference. OpenF1 is an unofficial project and is not associated in any way with the Formula 1 companies. F1, FORMULA ONE, FORMULA 1, FIA FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP, GRAND PRIX and related marks are trade marks of Formula One Licensing B.V.

Community and Support Roadmap Contributing Contributors Usage Guidelines Acknowledgments br-g/openf1 @brgodefroy Buy me a coffee Contact |  Made in Paris, France Introduction OpenF1 is an open-source API that provides real-time and historical Formula 1 data. The API offers a wealth of information, including lap timings, car telemetry, radio communications, and more. Whether you're looking to create interactive dashboards, dive deep into race analysis, or even develop connected objects that light up every time your favorite driver takes the lead, OpenF1 makes it all possible. Historical data is freely accessible and requires no authentication. Real-time data access, however, requires a paid account—apply by filling out this form . Data can be accessed in either JSON or CSV formats, making it user-friendly for both developers and non-developers alike.
For a quick start, you can access the API through your web browser. A sample URL is provided for each endpoint for easy reference. OpenF1 is an unofficial project and is not associated in any way with the Formula 1 companies. F1, FORMULA ONE, FORMULA 1, FIA FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP, GRAND PRIX and related marks are trade marks of Formula One Licensing B.V.

Community and Support Roadmap Contributing Contributors Usage Guidelines Acknowledgments br-g/openf1 @brgodefroy Buy me a coffee Contact |  Made in Paris, France Introduction OpenF1 is an open-source API that provides real-time and historical Formula 1 data. The API offers a wealth of information, including lap timings, car telemetry, radio communications, and more. Whether you're looking to create interactive dashboards, dive deep into race analysis, or even develop connected objects that light up every time your favorite driver takes the lead, OpenF1 makes it all possible.

Academic Integrity Declaration AI Acknowledgement Statement 2. Plagiarism 3. Regular commits to IRP repositories 4. Engaging with Supervisors and Documenting Meetings logbook.md An example of a logbook entry Academic Integrity and Misconduct # Academic integrity is essential to conducting research, earning a credible degree, and maintaining trust and reputation. Your work must be your own, properly attributed, and honestly reported. As postgraduate taught students working on your Independent Research Project (IRP), you are expected to demonstrate the highest standards of integrity, honesty, rigour, and accountability in every aspect of your work — including code development, written and oral dissemination, and all forms of communication with supervisors, staff, peers, external partners, and the wider public. Academic misconduct is taken very seriously and may lead to severe consequences, including failure of the module or termination of your degree programme. An academic misconduct investigation can be initiated at any time, even after graduation, if concerns about the authenticity or integrity of submitted work come to light. In addition to the university-wide academic integrity and misconduct policies, such as Academic Misconduct Policy and Procedure Guidance on Academic Integrity in Examinations and Assessments , here, we set the IRP-specific rules and expectations. You are responsible for understanding and adhering to all of them. A lack of familiarity with these requirements will not be accepted as a justification in cases of suspected academic misconduct. These policies include both university-wide regulations and module-specific rules and expectations that are non-negotiable. While students are encouraged to discuss these with their supervisors to better understand how to adhere to them in their specific projects, supervisors cannot override, modify, or make exceptions to these rules. 1. Academic Integrity Declaration # To establish rules and expectations around academic integrity for the Independent Research Project (IRP), all students are required to familiarise themselves with and submit an Academic Integrity Declaration: (Imperial login required) Academic Integrity Declaration (Publicly accessible) Academic Integrity Declaration This online form must be submitted twice during the IRP : once with your Project Plan and once with your Final Report and Code. The form must be submitted before the deadline for each deliverable, and submission is mandatory. It serves as your formal confirmation that you understand and agree to follow the IRP-specific academic integrity policies. By submitting the form, you confirm that you have read, understood, and will abide by all rules outlined. Failure to submit the form, make accurate disclosures, or comply with these rules and expectations may result in a formal academic misconduct investigation. The declaration covers several critical areas, such as: An explicit prohibition on the use of generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Bard, Claude, Scribbr) in any aspect of the preparation of written reports — including drafting, rewriting, rephrasing, correcting grammar or spelling, expanding content, or generating ideas or illustrations. The written reports must be entirely your own work, expressed in your own words and reasoning. By “written reports,” we mean the project plan and final report only, as described in the Deliverables section. A commitment to fully disclose any use of generative AI tools at any stage of the IRP - including code development, debugging, testing, planning, optimisation, documentation, packaging, or research. You must clearly identify each tool used and explicitly state which parts of your work were generated or influenced by it. A commitment that all submitted work reflects your personal knowledge, understanding, and technical skills. Any use of resources - including websites, open-source code, examples, published articles in scientific journals, news articles, pre-prints (e.g. in arXiv or institutional repositories), books, or AI-generated suggestions - must be properly cited. A strict ban on outsourcing any part of the IRP to third parties. All submitted work must be your own and must not have been previously submitted for assessment (no self-plagiarism). All submitted work must be developed during the official IRP period — between the designated start and end IRP dates. You may not rec"

Academic Integrity Declaration AI Acknowledgement Statement 2. Plagiarism 3. Regular commits to IRP repositories 4. Engaging with Supervisors and Documenting Meetings logbook.md An example of a logbook entry Academic Integrity and Misconduct # Academic integrity is essential to conducting research, earning a credible degree, and maintaining trust and reputation. Your work must be your own, properly attributed, and honestly reported. As postgraduate taught students working on your Independent Research Project (IRP), you are expected to demonstrate the highest standards of integrity, honesty, rigour, and accountability in every aspect of your work — including code development, written and oral dissemination, and all forms of communication with supervisors, staff, peers, external partners, and the wider public. Academic misconduct is taken very seriously and may lead to severe consequences, including failure of the module or termination of your degree programme. An academic misconduct investigation can be initiated at any time, even after graduation, if concerns about the authenticity or integrity of submitted work come to light. In addition to the university-wide academic integrity and misconduct policies, such as Academic Misconduct Policy and Procedure Guidance on Academic Integrity in Examinations and Assessments , here, we set the IRP-specific rules and expectations. You are responsible for understanding and adhering to all of them. A lack of familiarity with these requirements will not be accepted as a justification in cases of suspected academic misconduct. These policies include both university-wide regulations and module-specific rules and expectations that are non-negotiable. While students are encouraged to discuss these with their supervisors to better understand how to adhere to them in their specific projects, supervisors cannot override, modify, or make exceptions to these rules. 1. Academic Integrity Declaration # To establish rules and expectations around academic integrity for the Independent Research Project (IRP), all students are required to familiarise themselves with and submit an Academic Integrity Declaration: (Imperial login required) Academic Integrity Declaration (Publicly accessible) Academic Integrity Declaration This online form must be submitted twice during the IRP : once with your Project Plan and once with your Final Report and Code. The form must be submitted before the deadline for each deliverable, and submission is mandatory. It serves as your formal confirmation that you understand and agree to follow the IRP-specific academic integrity policies. By submitting the form, you confirm that you have read, understood, and will abide by all rules outlined. Failure to submit the form, make accurate disclosures, or comply with these rules and expectations may result in a formal academic misconduct investigation. The declaration covers several critical areas, such as: An explicit prohibition on the use of generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Bard, Claude, Scribbr) in any aspect of the preparation of written reports — including drafting, rewriting, rephrasing, correcting grammar or spelling, expanding content, or generating ideas or illustrations. The written reports must be entirely your own work, expressed in your own words and reasoning. By “written reports,” we mean the project plan and final report only, as described in the Deliverables section. A commitment to fully disclose any use of generative AI tools at any stage of the IRP - including code development, debugging, testing, planning, optimisation, documentation, packaging, or research. You must clearly identify each tool used and explicitly state which parts of your work were generated or influenced by it. A commitment that all submitted work reflects your personal knowledge, understanding, and technical skills. Any use of resources - including websites, open-source code, examples, published articles in scientific journals, news articles, pre-prints (e.g. in arXiv or institutional repositories), books, or AI-generated suggestions - must be properly cited. A strict ban on outsourcing any part of the IRP to third parties. All submitted work must be your own and must not have been previously submitted for assessment (no self-plagiarism). All submitted work must be developed during the official IRP period — between the designated start and end IRP dates. You may not rec"

A Golden Dataset is a single, well-defined, and trusted source of information often used by businesses for decision making and analytics. It consolidates and curates data from multiple sources to provide more accurate and consistent data. Functionality and Features Golden Datasets are used to optimize data processing and analytics. Some of its key features include: Data Consistency: Data is uniform across the board, eliminating discrepancies and facilitating accurate data-driven decision making. Reduction in Redundancy: By consolidating data sources , it eliminates repetitive data entries and inconsistencies. Increased Trust: Being a single source of truth, it enhances trustworthiness of the data in use. Benefits and Use Cases Golden Dataset plays a critical role in decision-making, reporting, and data analytics. Its advantages include: Improved Data Quality: Golden datasets ensure that the data used for analytics and decision-making is accurate and consistent. Optimized Decision Making: With a source of truth, decision-making processes become more streamlined and efficient. Increased Efficiency: By reducing data redundancy and inconsistencies, organizations can optimize their data management processes. Challenges and Limitations Despite benefits, Golden Dataset also has limitations: Data Latency: As data from multiple sources is consolidated, there can be delays in data availability. Data Dependency: The accuracy of the Golden Dataset is dependent on the quality of data inputs. Poor data quality can affect the Golden Dataset's accuracy. Integration with Data Lakehouse Golden Dataset fits naturally into a data lakehouse model. Data lakehouse , a blend of the best features of data warehouses and data lakes, can support and even enhance the functionality of the Golden Dataset. While Golden Dataset provides a single source of truth, a data lakehouse environment provides structured and unstructured data storage, making the data widely accessible for analytics and machine learning purposes.

The analysis of sustainability initiatives allows both organisations and stakeholders to make informed decisions on the type of initiatives that are more likely to create value for the various stakeholder groups. Analysis of the value creation implications of different types of initiatives can, in turn, ignite learning for organisations and stakeholders on how to best address crucial sustainability issues in a way that creates value for all. Dataset development Using the most advanced linguistic analytical techniques, such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), we identify and codify sustainability initiatives worldwide from public and private sectors, including institutions, cities, and universities. Through our analysis of the data we aim to answer the following questions: What the company has implemented or is currently implementing Who is taking action and their background (e.g. sector-level). This allows for further inquiries based on more aggregate data (sector or sector-country reports) Why the initiative is being pursued. Specific"

Members Online • cantonbecker App that will vibrate every minute or 5 minutes? (File under ""mindfulness"" or ""get better at noticing the passage of time"" ?) I'd like my watch to vibrate every minute or 5 minutes or maybe 10 minutes. Anyone heard of an app that does this, or something close enough? Shouldn't require any action on my part (e.g. I don't want to just set a timer and then have to snooze it every time it vibrates.) These kinds of apps in the full-size phone world are often filed under meditation / mindfulness e.g. as an aid to know when 10 minutes has gone by. I do understand this would suck the battery life pretty quickly, but the idea is that I'd only use it during certain times of they, e.g. when I'm trying to get out the door in the morning.

For more information, see Deliverables . Computing resources For more information on computing resources available to students, see Computing Resources . IRP-specific Academic Integrity Rules and Expectations IRP-specific rules and expectations around academic integrity are in Academic Integrity and Misconduct . All students are responsible for understanding and adhering to all of them. A lack of familiarity with these requirements will not be accepted as a justification in cases of suspected academic misconduct. Independent Research Project (IRP) is the capstone module in the Ada Lovelace Academy at Imperial College London for the following MSc courses: Applied Computational Science and Engineering (ACSE) Environmental Data Science and Machine Learning (EDSML) Geo-Energy with Machine Learning and Data Science (GEMS) It allows students to work independently to address a relevant real-world research question or tackle a commercial challenge by designing and implementing a computational solution . It is worth 30 ECTS - one-third of the total 90 ECTS required for the award of the Master’s degree. It takes place over the summer following the completion of the taught modules (for exact IRP dates, see Important dates , and for the curriculum, see MSc curriculum ). Upon successful completion of the IRP, students should be able to: Develop a computational solution from scratch, substantially extend the capabilities of an existing code, or build a model to analyse and interpret a substantial dataset. Contribute to an active research field or a commercial project. Creatively and critically employ techniques to solve open-ended, real-world, challenging problems. Effectively communicate their work by writing reports and defending it under critical questioning. Project requirements # The projects can come from different fields. For instance, in previous years, students worked on computational research and commercial projects in environmental science, geoscience and engineering, fundamental and applied physics, mathematics, chemistry, healthcare, finance, computer science, climate modelling, and many others. However, all projects must be computational and include a substantial coding component to address a relevant research question or tackle a commercial challenge. Specifically, a student is expected to either: Develop from scratch a simulation code, data processing or analysis pipeline, or machine learning model, to address a non-trivial problem involving a complex system, numerical model, or substantial dataset. OR Substantially extend or enhance an existing simulation codebase, data processing or analysis pipeline, or machine learning framework, and apply it to a substantial dataset or computational problem, for example by improving model performance, adding new components, or broadening applicability. Note For the ACSE and EDSML MSc courses, the projects can come from any field . On the other hand, for the GEMS MSc course, the project must address a geoscience and engineering problem . We also suggest referring to the marking criteria section in Marking criteria for an overview of what examiners are expected to evaluate. Collaboration and teamwork # Multiple students may work on the same project topic, either as part of a coordinated team effort or through parallel but related investigations. In such cases, students can collaborate by working on individual components of a larger project, or by tackling the same problem using different approaches or methodologies. Collaboration between students is encouraged; however, each student submits their own written reports and code, and it must be unambiguous from the submitted work what their contribution is. For further guidance on acceptable collaboration practices and attribution, please see the Academic Integrity and Misconduct .

Academic Integrity Declaration # All students must submit an Academic Integrity Declaration twice during the IRP: once with your Project Plan and once with your Final Report and Code. The form must be submitted before the deadline for each deliverable. For further information refer to Academic Integrity and Misconduct . We strongly advise all students to familiarise themselves well in advance with the IRP module-specific academic integrity rules and expectations. This includes the complete ban on the use of generative AI tools in preparing written reports. Written Reports # As part of the Independent Research Project (IRP), students are required to submit two written reports: Project Plan Final Report Both reports are mandatory and must be submitted in order to successfully complete the IRP. Submission is not optional, and failure to submit either report will result in an incomplete assessment of the module. Title page # The first page of the project plan and the final report must include the following information: university, department, MSc course, student’s name, submission date, project title, GitHub IRP repository link, and the supervisors. Example Word and LaTeX title page templates are provided in the template repository . These templates are provided as guidance - you are free to design your own title page, provided that all required information is included and clearly presented. Tip Your title should be concise, specific, and descriptive — clearly indicating the focus of your project. It may differ from the original title approved at the start of the IRP, and you are allowed to refine or update it between the project plan and the final report. Tip You are welcome to include additional individuals on the title page as supervisors if you wish to acknowledge their support or contribution to your learning. These individuals do not need to be officially listed in the IRP records, and you do not need prior approval from the IRP Team to include them. This is particularly important to ensure that everyone who supported your work — such as PhD students or postdocs — is given the credit they deserve. Formatting # You are free to format your project plan and final report in a style of your choosing. However, we strongly recommend that you follow the Style Guide published by the British Dyslexia Association . This guide promotes inclusive and accessible document design, helping ensure that your work is easy to read and navigate for all audiences — including examiners, moderators, and peers with visual impairments or learning differences. Key principles include using clear fonts, sufficient line spacing, meaningful headings, left-aligned text, and avoiding dense blocks of text or excessive italics and underlining. Similarly, to ensure your figures are accessible to all readers, use high-contrast colour schemes, large and legible text, and clear legends. Avoid relying solely on colour to convey meaning — use patterns, textures, labels, or symbols where appropriate. For more guidance, see Dos and Don’ts on Designing for Accessibility – GOV.UK Data Visualizations, Charts, and Graphs – Digital Accessibility by Harvard . Length and file size limits # The written reports for the IRP must adhere to the following limits: written report word limit figure + table limit max PDF file size Project plan 1,500 5 4 MB Final report 5,000 10 8 MB Reports that are shorter than the stated limits will not be penalised.

For more information, see Deliverables . Computing resources For more information on computing resources available to students, see Computing Resources . IRP-specific Academic Integrity Rules and Expectations IRP-specific rules and expectations around academic integrity are in Academic Integrity and Misconduct . All students are responsible for understanding and adhering to all of them. A lack of familiarity with these requirements will not be accepted as a justification in cases of suspected academic misconduct. Independent Research Project (IRP) is the capstone module in the Ada Lovelace Academy at Imperial College London for the following MSc courses: Applied Computational Science and Engineering (ACSE) Environmental Data Science and Machine Learning (EDSML) Geo-Energy with Machine Learning and Data Science (GEMS) It allows students to work independently to address a relevant real-world research question or tackle a commercial challenge by designing and implementing a computational solution . It is worth 30 ECTS - one-third of the total 90 ECTS required for the award of the Master’s degree. It takes place over the summer following the completion of the taught modules (for exact IRP dates, see Important dates , and for the curriculum, see MSc curriculum ). Upon successful completion of the IRP, students should be able to: Develop a computational solution from scratch, substantially extend the capabilities of an existing code, or build a model to analyse and interpret a substantial dataset. Contribute to an active research field or a commercial project. Creatively and critically employ techniques to solve open-ended, real-world, challenging problems. Effectively communicate their work by writing reports and defending it under critical questioning. Project requirements # The projects can come from different fields. For instance, in previous years, students worked on computational research and commercial projects in environmental science, geoscience and engineering, fundamental and applied physics, mathematics, chemistry, healthcare, finance, computer science, climate modelling, and many others. However, all projects must be computational and include a substantial coding component to address a relevant research question or tackle a commercial challenge. Specifically, a student is expected to either: Develop from scratch a simulation code, data processing or analysis pipeline, or machine learning model, to address a non-trivial problem involving a complex system, numerical model, or substantial dataset. OR Substantially extend or enhance an existing simulation codebase, data processing or analysis pipeline, or machine learning framework, and apply it to a substantial dataset or computational problem, for example by improving model performance, adding new components, or broadening applicability. Note For the ACSE and EDSML MSc courses, the projects can come from any field . On the other hand, for the GEMS MSc course, the project must address a geoscience and engineering problem . We also suggest referring to the marking criteria section in Marking criteria for an overview of what examiners are expected to evaluate. Collaboration and teamwork # Multiple students may work on the same project topic, either as part of a coordinated team effort or through parallel but related investigations. In such cases, students can collaborate by working on individual components of a larger project, or by tackling the same problem using different approaches or methodologies. Collaboration between students is encouraged; however, each student submits their own written reports and code, and it must be unambiguous from the submitted work what their contribution is. For further guidance on acceptable collaboration practices and attribution, please see the Academic Integrity and Misconduct .

How to Make a Gantt Chart in Excel ► 12:54 What is a Gantt Chart? A Gantt chart is a tool for project management developed by Henry Gantt in the early 1900s. It uses horizontal bars to show the periods of time when each task or resource has been scheduled. It may also show the portion of work completed, task dependencies, milestones, and other data. A vast number of software applications have been developed for project management, and most of these use a Gantt chart to visualize the project schedule. However, if you don't need all the bells and whistles of these applications, a spreadsheet can be a simple solution.

How to Use and Customize the Simple Gantt Chart Although the Excel spreadsheet is compatible with multiple versions of Excel, the following instructions are based on using Excel 2016. See the article "" How to Use Conditional Formatting in Excel "" to learn how to create a simple Gantt chart like this template. Adding More Tasks When you insert new tasks, you should first insert a blank row and then enter the task and dates. Right-click on the row number and select Insert. If you do this, the formatting will be copied automatically from the row above. NOTE You can also copy a row and then insert the copied row, but Excel doesn't automatically merge conditional formatting rules when you do this, resulting in fractured conditional format rules. This is a known problem that Excel will hopefully fix some day. Changing the Weeks Displayed in the Gantt Chart You can edit the Display Week number to change the period of time displayed in the Gantt Chart. Week 1 is the week containing the Project Start Date. Incrementing the display week number has the effect of scrolling the gantt chart 1 week at a time. HINT Add a Scroll Bar! If you are using Excel 2007/2010/2013/2016, you can add a scroll bar form control to the header and link the form control to the cell containing the Display Week number, just as in the original Gantt Chart Template .

If your project covers a longer period of time (many months), and you don't want to add more columns to the chart, you would need to change the way the dates are displayed in the rows above the Gantt chart as well as the conditional formatting rules (possible, but not simple).

How to Use and Customize the Simple Gantt Chart Although the Excel spreadsheet is compatible with multiple versions of Excel, the following instructions are based on using Excel 2016. See the article "" How to Use Conditional Formatting in Excel "" to learn how to create a simple Gantt chart like this template. Adding More Tasks When you insert new tasks, you should first insert a blank row and then enter the task and dates. Right-click on the row number and select Insert. If you do this, the formatting will be copied automatically from the row above. NOTE You can also copy a row and then insert the copied row, but Excel doesn't automatically merge conditional formatting rules when you do this, resulting in fractured conditional format rules. This is a known problem that Excel will hopefully fix some day. Changing the Weeks Displayed in the Gantt Chart You can edit the Display Week number to change the period of time displayed in the Gantt Chart. Week 1 is the week containing the Project Start Date. Incrementing the display week number has the effect of scrolling the gantt chart 1 week at a time. HINT Add a Scroll Bar! If you are using Excel 2007/2010/2013/2016, you can add a scroll bar form control to the header and link the form control to the cell containing the Display Week number, just as in the original Gantt Chart Template . Adding More Columns to the Gantt Chart To increase the time span displayed in the spreadsheet, add columns to the right of the Gantt chart by copying and pasting groups of 7 columns (because the column labels on row 4 are merged cells).

If your project covers a longer period of time (many months), and you don't want to add more columns to the chart, you would need to change the way the dates are displayed in the rows above the Gantt chart as well as the conditional formatting rules (possible, but not simple).

How to Make a Gantt Chart in Excel ► 12:54 What is a Gantt Chart? A Gantt chart is a tool for project management developed by Henry Gantt in the early 1900s. It uses horizontal bars to show the periods of time when each task or resource has been scheduled. It may also show the portion of work completed, task dependencies, milestones, and other data.

Academic Integrity Declaration # All students must submit an Academic Integrity Declaration twice during the IRP: once with your Project Plan and once with your Final Report and Code. The form must be submitted before the deadline for each deliverable. For further information refer to Academic Integrity and Misconduct . We strongly advise all students to familiarise themselves well in advance with the IRP module-specific academic integrity rules and expectations. This includes the complete ban on the use of generative AI tools in preparing written reports. Written Reports # As part of the Independent Research Project (IRP), students are required to submit two written reports: Project Plan Final Report Both reports are mandatory and must be submitted in order to successfully complete the IRP. Submission is not optional, and failure to submit either report will result in an incomplete assessment of the module. Title page # The first page of the project plan and the final report must include the following information: university, department, MSc course, student’s name, submission date, project title, GitHub IRP repository link, and the supervisors. Example Word and LaTeX title page templates are provided in the template repository . These templates are provided as guidance - you are free to design your own title page, provided that all required information is included and clearly presented. Tip Your title should be concise, specific, and descriptive — clearly indicating the focus of your project. It may differ from the original title approved at the start of the IRP, and you are allowed to refine or update it between the project plan and the final report. Tip You are welcome to include additional individuals on the title page as supervisors if you wish to acknowledge their support or contribution to your learning. These individuals do not need to be officially listed in the IRP records, and you do not need prior approval from the IRP Team to include them. This is particularly important to ensure that everyone who supported your work — such as PhD students or postdocs — is given the credit they deserve. Formatting # You are free to format your project plan and final report in a style of your choosing. However, we strongly recommend that you follow the Style Guide published by the British Dyslexia Association . This guide promotes inclusive and accessible document design, helping ensure that your work is easy to read and navigate for all audiences — including examiners, moderators, and peers with visual impairments or learning differences. Key principles include using clear fonts, sufficient line spacing, meaningful headings, left-aligned text, and avoiding dense blocks of text or excessive italics and underlining. Similarly, to ensure your figures are accessible to all readers, use high-contrast colour schemes, large and legible text, and clear legends. Avoid relying solely on colour to convey meaning — use patterns, textures, labels, or symbols where appropriate. For more guidance, see Dos and Don’ts on Designing for Accessibility – GOV.UK Data Visualizations, Charts, and Graphs – Digital Accessibility by Harvard . Length and file size limits # The written reports for the IRP must adhere to the following limits: written report word limit figure + table limit max PDF file size Project plan 1,500 5 4 MB Final report 5,000 10 8 MB Reports that are shorter than the stated limits will not be penalised. A small (max. 5%) tolerance is allowed to account for variation between word-counting tools. The following elements are excluded from the word count: Title page Acknowledgements, including the AI Acknowledgements section Table of contents List of figures / tables / symbols / abbreviations Section/subsection titles Text within figures or tables (e.g. axis labels, legends, annot"

Knowing the word count of a text can be important. For example, if an author has to write a minimum or maximum amount of words for an article, essay, report, story, book, paper, you name it. WordCounter will help to make sure its word count reaches a specific requirement or stays within a certain limit. In addition, WordCounter shows you the top 10 keywords and keyword density of the article you're writing. This allows you to know which keywords you use how often and at what percentages. This can prevent you from over-using certain words or word combinations and check for best distribution of keywords in your writing. In the Details overview you can see the average speaking and reading time for your text, while Reading Level is an indicator of the education level a person would need in order to understand the words you’re using.

Academic Integrity Declaration # All students must submit an Academic Integrity Declaration twice during the IRP: once with your Project Plan and once with your Final Report and Code. The form must be submitted before the deadline for each deliverable. For further information refer to Academic Integrity and Misconduct . We strongly advise all students to familiarise themselves well in advance with the IRP module-specific academic integrity rules and expectations. This includes the complete ban on the use of generative AI tools in preparing written reports. Written Reports # As part of the Independent Research Project (IRP), students are required to submit two written reports: Project Plan Final Report Both reports are mandatory and must be submitted in order to successfully complete the IRP. Submission is not optional, and failure to submit either report will result in an incomplete assessment of the module. Title page # The first page of the project plan and the final report must include the following information: university, department, MSc course, student’s name, submission date, project title, GitHub IRP repository link, and the supervisors. Example Word and LaTeX title page templates are provided in the template repository . These templates are provided as guidance - you are free to design your own title page, provided that all required information is included and clearly presented. Tip Your title should be concise, specific, and descriptive — clearly indicating the focus of your project. It may differ from the original title approved at the start of the IRP, and you are allowed to refine or update it between the project plan and the final report. Tip You are welcome to include additional individuals on the title page as supervisors if you wish to acknowledge their support or contribution to your learning. These individuals do not need to be officially listed in the IRP records, and you do not need prior approval from the IRP Team to include them. This is particularly important to ensure that everyone who supported your work — such as PhD students or postdocs — is given the credit they deserve. Formatting # You are free to format your project plan and final report in a style of your choosing. However, we strongly recommend that you follow the Style Guide published by the British Dyslexia Association . This guide promotes inclusive and accessible document design, helping ensure that your work is easy to read and navigate for all audiences — including examiners, moderators, and peers with visual impairments or learning differences. Key principles include using clear fonts, sufficient line spacing, meaningful headings, left-aligned text, and avoiding dense blocks of text or excessive italics and underlining. Similarly, to ensure your figures are accessible to all readers, use high-contrast colour schemes, large and legible text, and clear legends. Avoid relying solely on colour to convey meaning — use patterns, textures, labels, or symbols where appropriate. For more guidance, see Dos and Don’ts on Designing for Accessibility – GOV.UK Data Visualizations, Charts, and Graphs – Digital Accessibility by Harvard . Length and file size limits # The written reports for the IRP must adhere to the following limits: written report word limit figure + table limit max PDF file size Project plan 1,500 5 4 MB Final report 5,000 10 8 MB Reports that are shorter than the stated limits will not be penalised. A small (max. 5%) tolerance is allowed to account for variation between word-counting tools.

Hence, companies regularly publish sustainability reports to shed light on their impact on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. Problem: Sustainability reports are written by companies themselves and are therefore considered a company-controlled source. Contrary, studies reveal that non-corporate channels (e.g., media coverage) represent the main driver for ESG transparency. However, analysing media coverage regarding ESG factors is challenging since (1) the amount of published news articles grows daily, (2) media coverage data does not necessarily deal with an ESG-relevant topic, meaning that it must be carefully filtered, and (3) the majority of media coverage data is unstructured. Research Goal: We aim to extract ESG-relevant information from textual media reactions automatically to calculate an ESG score for a given company. Our goal is to reduce the cost of ESG data collection and make ESG information available to the general public. Contribution: Our contributions are three-fold: First, we publish a corpus of 432,411 news headlines annotated as being environmental-, governance-, social-related, or ESG-irrelevant. Second, we present our tool-supported approach called ESG-Miner capable of analyzing and evaluating headlines on corporate ESG-performance automatically. Third, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in an experiment and apply the ESG-Miner on 3000 manually labeled headlines. Our approach processes 96.7 % of the headlines correctly and shows a great performance in detecting environmental-related headlines along with their correct sentiment. We encourage fellow researchers and practitioners to use the ESG-Miner at this https URL .

In recent years, investors and regulators have pushed ESG investing to the mainstream due to the urgency of climate change. This has led to the rise of ESG scores to evaluate an investment's credentials as socially responsible. While demand for ESG scores is high, their quality varies wildly. Quantitative techniques can be applied to improve ESG scores, thus, responsible investing. To contribute to resource building for ESG and financial text mining, we pioneer the ESG-FTSE corpus. We further present the first of its kind ESG annotation schema. It has three levels: a binary classification (relevant versus irrelevant news articles), ESG classification (ESG-related news articles), and target company. Both supervised and unsupervised learning experiments for ESG relevance detection were conducted to demonstrate that the corpus can be used in different settings to derive accurate ESG predictions.

This study used primary data from 44 PEX-listed companies. A context analysis technique was used through company websites and disclosures, the entire population (308 observations) was used for this study, and the study used STATA utilizing the required statistical analysis for this research. The study finds that environmental, social, and governance disclosures significantly influence the Return on Equity and Return on Assets. Testing for the moderating role of Corporate Governance, especially board diversity and size, shows that board diversity moderates the association between social and governance disclosure and firm performance. Board size moderates the relationship between social disclosure and firm performance. By contrast, Board Size and Diversity do not moderate the relationship between environmental disclosure and firm performance. The study contributes to the literature as the first of its kind conducted in Palestine, examining the moderating effects of board size and diversity on the association between ESG disclosure and firm performance.

After the 2008 financial crisis, firms should pay more attention to a wide range of stakeholders’ desires. Therefore, they are more inclined to modify their conduct as necessary and use their imaginations to develop novel solutions to meet these parties’ needs. One of the main strategies that businesses need to employ to attract more stakeholders is engaging in non-financial activities [ 1 ]. It has been proposed that non-financial operations (such as sustainability and environmental projects) that aim to serve more stakeholders than shareholders can enhance financial success [ 2 ]. Sustainability is the process of controlling how an organization affects social, economic, and environmental issues to identify possibilities and dangers that could eventually jeopardize a company's success [ 3 ]. Organizations, authorities, and academics have provided integrated sustainability, which, since the announcement of the Environmental Agreement in 2020, has paid more attention to corporate governance, social responsibility, and environmental factors. This is because of the expectation that sustainability will be essential for enhancing a business's financial success and assisting its users in reaching and overseeing their objectives. Businesses now provide nonfinancial and financial data to satisfy stakeholders' information requirements. Concerns have been expressed regarding matters such as child labor, management of product liability,"

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were formulated by the United Nations in 2015 to address these global challenges by 2030. Natural language processing techniques can help uncover discussions on SDGs within research literature. We propose a completely automated pipeline that (1) fetches content from academic literature and prepares datasets dedicated to five groups of SDGs; (2) performs topic modeling, a statistical technique used to identify topics in large collections of textual data; and (3) enables topic exploration through keywords-based search and topic frequency time series extraction. For topic modeling, we leverage the stack of BERTopic scaled up to be applied on large corpora of textual documents (we find hundreds of topics on hundreds of thousands of documents), introducing (i) a novel LLM-based embeddings computation for representing scientific abstracts in the continuous space, and (ii) a hyperparameter optimizer to efficiently find the best configuration for any new dataset. We additionally produce the visualization of results on interactive dashboards reporting topics’ temporal evolution. Results are made inspectable and explorable, contributing to the interpretability of the topic modeling process. The proposed LLM-based topic modeling pipeline allows users to capture insights on the evolution of the attitude toward SDGs within scientific abstracts in the 2006–2023 time span. All the results are reproducible by using our system; the workflow can be generalized to be applied at any point in time to any large corpus of text data. Introduction Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are 17 United Nations’ global objectives identified to address some of the biggest challenges of human civilization [ 1 ]. These goals include issues such as gender equality and education, poverty and hunger, health, and climate change. Each goal is designed to address a specific issue or a set of strongly related issues; however, all goals should work together to create a better and more sustainable future for humanity. We use keywords that describe SDGs as our point of access to a scientific literature landscape that is typically very vast and for which easy, flexible exploration is problematic. We accessed academic research outcomes through the Elsevier Scopus database, which stores a rich content of abstracts along with their metadata, via their RESTful API [ 2 ], focusing on the years’ range 2006–2023. For the analysis, we follow an unsupervised statistical approach based on natural language processing, specifically focused on topic modeling [ 3 ]. Unsupervised Topic Modeling is used to discover and analyze latent topics within a document, without leveraging pre-existing labels or supervision. This method works under the assumption that each document represents a single topic, or at least that one topic is preponderant, so as to exclude encompassing multiple topics at the same time. In our work, we frame topic modeling as a clustering task [ 4 ] over the latent space of embeddings, differently from other approaches that train end-to-end models for topic modeling, either based on classical methods [ 5 ] or language models [ 6 ]. Egger and Yu [ 7 ] surveyed four topic modeling techniques, namely latent Dirichlet allocation, non-negative matrix factorization, Top2Vec, and BERTopic [ 8 ]. In line with their analysis and the suggestions of a more recent survey by Abdelrazek et al. [ 9 ], we selected the neural model BERTopic to implement our approach for topic modeling from document clustering. Neural topic models are particularly appropriate to guarantee scalability (both in terms of model and data), flexibility (i.e., the ability to adapt to different tasks like, in our case, dynamic topic modeling), and the possibility of being embedded in end-to-end data pipelines; these aspects are particularly important in our scenario.

However, this is hindered by the complexity and volume of corporate sustainability data (i.e. sustainability disclosures), not least by the effectiveness of the NLP tools used to analyse them. To this end, we identify three primary challenges - immateriality, complexity, and subjectivity, that exacerbate the difficulty of extracting insights from sustainability disclosures. To address these issues, we introduce ESGSenticNet, a publicly available knowledge base for sustainability analysis. ESGSenticNet is constructed from a neurosymbolic framework that integrates specialised concept parsing, GPT-4o inference, and semi-supervised label propagation, together with a hierarchical taxonomy. This approach culminates in a structured knowledge base of 44k knowledge triplets - ('halve carbon emission', supports, 'emissions control'), for effective sustainability analysis. Experiments indicate that ESGSenticNet, when deployed as a lexical method, more effectively captures relevant and actionable sustainability information from sustainability disclosures compared to state of the art baselines. Besides capturing a high number of unique ESG topic terms, ESGSenticNet outperforms baselines on the ESG relatedness and ESG action orientation of these terms by 26% and 31% respectively. These metrics describe the extent to which topic terms are related to ESG, and depict an action toward ESG. Moreover, when deployed as a lexical method, ESGSenticNet does not require any training, possessing a key advantage in its simplicity for non-technical stakeholders.

The analysis of sustainability initiatives allows both organisations and stakeholders to make informed decisions on the type of initiatives that are more likely to create value for the various stakeholder groups. Analysis of the value creation implications of different types of initiatives can, in turn, ignite learning for organisations and stakeholders on how to best address crucial sustainability issues in a way that creates value for all. Dataset development Using the most advanced linguistic analytical techniques, such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), we identify and codify sustainability initiatives worldwide from public and private sectors, including institutions, cities, and universities. Through our analysis of the data we aim to answer the following questions: What the company has implemented or is currently implementing Who is taking action and their background (e.g. sector-level). This allows for further inquiries based on more aggregate data (sector or sector-country reports) Why the initiative is being pursued. Specific"

Academic Integrity Declaration # All students must submit an Academic Integrity Declaration twice during the IRP: once with your Project Plan and once with your Final Report and Code. The form must be submitted before the deadline for each deliverable. For further information refer to Academic Integrity and Misconduct . We strongly advise all students to familiarise themselves well in advance with the IRP module-specific academic integrity rules and expectations. This includes the complete ban on the use of generative AI tools in preparing written reports. Written Reports # As part of the Independent Research Project (IRP), students are required to submit two written reports: Project Plan Final Report Both reports are mandatory and must be submitted in order to successfully complete the IRP. Submission is not optional, and failure to submit either report will result in an incomplete assessment of the module. Title page # The first page of the project plan and the final report must include the following information: university, department, MSc course, student’s name, submission date, project title, GitHub IRP repository link, and the supervisors. Example Word and LaTeX title page templates are provided in the template repository . These templates are provided as guidance - you are free to design your own title page, provided that all required information is included and clearly presented. Tip Your title should be concise, specific, and descriptive — clearly indicating the focus of your project. It may differ from the original title approved at the start of the IRP, and you are allowed to refine or update it between the project plan and the final report. Tip You are welcome to include additional individuals on the title page as supervisors if you wish to acknowledge their support or contribution to your learning. These individuals do not need to be officially listed in the IRP records, and you do not need prior approval from the IRP Team to include them. This is particularly important to ensure that everyone who supported your work — such as PhD students or postdocs — is given the credit they deserve. Formatting # You are free to format your project plan and final report in a style of your choosing. However, we strongly recommend that you follow the Style Guide published by the British Dyslexia Association . This guide promotes inclusive and accessible document design, helping ensure that your work is easy to read and navigate for all audiences — including examiners, moderators, and peers with visual impairments or learning differences. Key principles include using clear fonts, sufficient line spacing, meaningful headings, left-aligned text, and avoiding dense blocks of text or excessive italics and underlining. Similarly, to ensure your figures are accessible to all readers, use high-contrast colour schemes, large and legible text, and clear legends. Avoid relying solely on colour to convey meaning — use patterns, textures, labels, or symbols where appropriate. For more guidance, see Dos and Don’ts on Designing for Accessibility – GOV.UK Data Visualizations, Charts, and Graphs – Digital Accessibility by Harvard . Length and file size limits # The written reports for the IRP must adhere to the following limits: written report word limit figure + table limit max PDF file size Project plan 1,500 5 4 MB Final report 5,000 10 8 MB Reports that are shorter than the stated limits will not be penalised. A small (max. 5%) tolerance is allowed to account for variation between word-counting tools.

For more information, see Deliverables . Computing resources For more information on computing resources available to students, see Computing Resources . IRP-specific Academic Integrity Rules and Expectations IRP-specific rules and expectations around academic integrity are in Academic Integrity and Misconduct . All students are responsible for understanding and adhering to all of them. A lack of familiarity with these requirements will not be accepted as a justification in cases of suspected academic misconduct. Independent Research Project (IRP) is the capstone module in the Ada Lovelace Academy at Imperial College London for the following MSc courses: Applied Computational Science and Engineering (ACSE) Environmental Data Science and Machine Learning (EDSML) Geo-Energy with Machine Learning and Data Science (GEMS) It allows students to work independently to address a relevant real-world research question or tackle a commercial challenge by designing and implementing a computational solution . It is worth 30 ECTS - one-third of the total 90 ECTS required for the award of the Master’s degree. It takes place over the summer following the completion of the taught modules (for exact IRP dates, see Important dates , and for the curriculum, see MSc curriculum ). Upon successful completion of the IRP, students should be able to: Develop a computational solution from scratch, substantially extend the capabilities of an existing code, or build a model to analyse and interpret a substantial dataset. Contribute to an active research field or a commercial project. Creatively and critically employ techniques to solve open-ended, real-world, challenging problems. Effectively communicate their work by writing reports and defending it under critical questioning. Project requirements # The projects can come from different fields. For instance, in previous years, students worked on computational research and commercial projects in environmental science, geoscience and engineering, fundamental and applied physics, mathematics, chemistry, healthcare, finance, computer science, climate modelling, and many others. However, all projects must be computational and include a substantial coding component to address a relevant research question or tackle a commercial challenge. Specifically, a student is expected to either: Develop from scratch a simulation code, data processing or analysis pipeline, or machine learning model, to address a non-trivial problem involving a complex system, numerical model, or substantial dataset. OR Substantially extend or enhance an existing simulation codebase, data processing or analysis pipeline, or machine learning framework, and apply it to a substantial dataset or computational problem, for example by improving model performance, adding new components, or broadening applicability. Note For the ACSE and EDSML MSc courses, the projects can come from any field . On the other hand, for the GEMS MSc course, the project must address a geoscience and engineering problem . We also suggest referring to the marking criteria section in Marking criteria for an overview of what examiners are expected to evaluate. Collaboration and teamwork # Multiple students may work on the same project topic, either as part of a coordinated team effort or through parallel but related investigations. In such cases, students can collaborate by working on individual components of a larger project, or by tackling the same problem using different approaches or methodologies. Collaboration between students is encouraged; however, each student submits their own written reports and code, and it must be unambiguous from the submitted work what their contribution is. For further guidance on acceptable collaboration practices and attribution, please see the Academic Integrity and Misconduct .

      value: 66.59096432882667 MTEB is a massive benchmark for measuring the performance of text embedding models on diverse embedding tasks. The 🥇 leaderboard provides a holistic view of the best text embedding models out there on a variety of tasks. The 📝 paper gives background on the tasks and datasets in MTEB and analyzes leaderboard results! The 💻 Github repo contains the code for benchmarking and submitting any model of your choice to the leaderboard. Why Text Embeddings? Text Embeddings are vector representations of text that encode semantic information. As machines require numerical inputs to perform computations, text embeddings are a crucial component of many downstream NLP applications. For example, Google uses text embeddings to power their search engine . Text Embeddings can also be used for finding patterns in large amount of text via clustering or as inputs to text classification models, such as in our recent SetFit work. The quality of text embeddings, however, is highly dependent on the embedding model used. MTEB is designed to help you find the best embedding model out there for a variety of tasks! MTEB 🐋 Massive : MTEB includes 56 datasets across 8 tasks and currently summarizes >2000 results on the leaderboard . 🌎 Multilingual : MTEB contains up to 112 different languages! We have benchmarked several multilingual models on Bitext Mining, Classification, and STS. 🦚 Extensible : Be it new tasks, datasets, metrics, or leaderboard additions, any contribution is very welcome. Check out the GitHub repository to submit to the leaderboard or solve open issues . We hope you join us on the journey of finding the best text embedding model! Overview of tasks and datasets in MTEB. Multilingual datasets are marked with a purple shade. Models For the initial benchmarking of MTEB, we focused on models claiming state-of-the-art results and popular models on the Hub. This led to a high representation of transformers. 🤖 Models by average English MTEB score (y) vs speed (x) vs embedding size (circle size). We grouped models into the following three attributes to simplify finding the best model for your task: 🏎 Maximum speed Models like Glove offer high speed, but suffer from a lack of context awareness resulting in low average MTEB scores. ⚖️ Speed and performance Slightly slower, but significantly stronger, all-mpnet-base-v2 or all-MiniLM-L6-v2 provide a good balance between speed and performance. 💪 Maximum performance Multi-billion parameter models like ST5-XXL , GTR-XXL or SGPT-5.8B-msmarco dominate on MTEB. They tend to also produce bigger embeddings like SGPT-5.8B-msmarco which produces 4096 dimensional embeddings requiring more storage! Model performance varies a lot depending on the task and dataset, so we recommend checking the various tabs of the leaderboard before deciding which model to use! Benchmark your model Using the MTEB library , you can benchmark any model that produces embeddings and add its results to the public leaderboard. Let's run through a quick example! First, install the library: pip install mteb Next, benchmark a model on a dataset, for example komninos word embeddings on Banking77 . from mteb import MTEB from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model_name = ""average_word_embeddings_komninos"" model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)

evaluation = MTEB(tasks=[ ""Banking77Classification"" ])
results = evaluation.run(model, output_folder= f""results/ {model_name} "" ) This should produce a results/average_word_embeddings_komninos/Banking77Classification.json file! Now you can submit the results to the leaderboard by adding it to the metadata of the README.md of any model on the Hub. Run our automatic script to generate the metadata: python mteb_meta.py results/average_word_embeddings_komninos The script will produce a mteb_metadata.md file that looks like this:
```sh tags:
- mteb
model-index:
- name: average_word_embeddings_komninos
  results:
  - task:
      type: Classification

Apart from counting words and characters, our online editor can help you to improve word choice and writing style, and, optionally, help you to detect grammar mistakes and plagiarism. To check word count, simply place your cursor into the text box above and start typing. You'll see the number of characters and words increase or decrease as you type, delete, and edit them. You can also copy and paste text from another program over into the online editor above. The Auto-Save feature will make sure you won't lose any changes while editing, even if you leave the site and come back later. Tip: Bookmark this page now. Knowing the word count of a text can be important. For example, if an author has to write a minimum or maximum amount of words for an article, essay, report, story, book, paper, you name it. WordCounter will help to make sure its word count reaches a specific requirement or stays within a certain limit. In addition, WordCounter shows you the top 10 keywords and keyword density of the article you're writing. This allows you to know which keywords you use how often and at what percentages. This can prevent you from over-using certain words or word combinations and check for best distribution of keywords in your writing. In the Details overview you can see the average speaking and reading time for your text, while Reading Level is an indicator of the education level a person would need in order to understand the words you’re using.

NSGA-Net is designed with three goals in mind: (1) a procedure considering multiple and conflicting objectives, (2) an efficient procedure balancing exploration and exploitation of the space of potential neural network architectures, and (3) a procedure finding a diverse set of trade-off network architectures achieved in a single run. NSGA-Net is a population-based search algorithm that explores a space of potential neural network architectures in three steps, namely, a population initialization step that is based on prior-knowledge from hand-crafted architectures, an exploration step comprising crossover and mutation of architectures, and finally an exploitation step that utilizes the hidden useful knowledge stored in the entire history of evaluated neural architectures in the form of a Bayesian Network. Experimental results suggest that combining the dual objectives of minimizing an error metric and computational complexity, as measured by FLOPs, allows NSGA-Net to find competitive neural architectures. Moreover, NSGA-Net achieves error rate on the CIFAR-10 dataset on par with other state-of-the-art NAS methods while using orders of magnitude less computational resources. These results are encouraging and shows the promise to further use of EC methods in various deep-learning paradigms.

Your work must be your own, properly attributed, and honestly reported. As postgraduate taught students working on your Independent Research Project (IRP), you are expected to demonstrate the highest standards of integrity, honesty, rigour, and accountability in every aspect of your work — including code development, written and oral dissemination, and all forms of communication with supervisors, staff, peers, external partners, and the wider public. Academic misconduct is taken very seriously and may lead to severe consequences, including failure of the module or termination of your degree programme. An academic misconduct investigation can be initiated at any time, even after graduation, if concerns about the authenticity or integrity of submitted work come to light. In addition to the university-wide academic integrity and misconduct policies, such as Academic Misconduct Policy and Procedure Guidance on Academic Integrity in Examinations and Assessments , here, we set the IRP-specific rules and expectations. You are responsible for understanding and adhering to all of them. A lack of familiarity with these requirements will not be accepted as a justification in cases of suspected academic misconduct. These policies include both university-wide regulations and module-specific rules and expectations that are non-negotiable. While students are encouraged to discuss these with their supervisors to better understand how to adhere to them in their specific projects, supervisors cannot override, modify, or make exceptions to these rules. 1. Academic Integrity Declaration # To establish rules and expectations around academic integrity for the Independent Research Project (IRP), all students are required to familiarise themselves with and submit an Academic Integrity Declaration: (Imperial login required) Academic Integrity Declaration (Publicly accessible) Academic Integrity Declaration This online form must be submitted twice during the IRP : once with your Project Plan and once with your Final Report and Code. The form must be submitted before the deadline for each deliverable, and submission is mandatory. It serves as your formal confirmation that you understand and agree to follow the IRP-specific academic integrity policies. By submitting the form, you confirm that you have read, understood, and will abide by all rules outlined. Failure to submit the form, make accurate disclosures, or comply with these rules and expectations may result in a formal academic misconduct investigation. The declaration covers several critical areas, such as: An explicit prohibition on the use of generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Bard, Claude, Scribbr) in any aspect of the preparation of written reports — including drafting, rewriting, rephrasing, correcting grammar or spelling, expanding content, or generating ideas or illustrations. The written reports must be entirely your own work, expressed in your own words and reasoning. By “written reports,” we mean the project plan and final report only, as described in the Deliverables section. A commitment to fully disclose any use of generative AI tools at any stage of the IRP - including code development, debugging, testing, planning, optimisation, documentation, packaging, or research. You must clearly identify each tool used and explicitly state which parts of your work were generated or influenced by it. A commitment that all submitted work reflects your personal knowledge, understanding, and technical skills. Any use of resources - including websites, open-source code, examples, published articles in scientific journals, news articles, pre-prints (e.g. in arXiv or institutional repositories), books, or AI-generated suggestions - must be properly cited. A strict ban on outsourcing any part of the IRP to third parties. All submitted work must be your own and must not have been previously submitted for assessment (no self-plagiarism). All submitted work must be developed during the official IRP period — between the designated start and end IRP dates. You may not rec"

IRP-specific Academic Integrity Rules and Expectations IRP-specific rules and expectations around academic integrity are in Academic Integrity and Misconduct . All students are responsible for understanding and adhering to all of them. A lack of familiarity with these requirements will not be accepted as a justification in cases of suspected academic misconduct. Independent Research Project (IRP) is the capstone module in the Ada Lovelace Academy at Imperial College London for the following MSc courses: Applied Computational Science and Engineering (ACSE) Environmental Data Science and Machine Learning (EDSML) Geo-Energy with Machine Learning and Data Science (GEMS) It allows students to work independently to address a relevant real-world research question or tackle a commercial challenge by designing and implementing a computational solution . It is worth 30 ECTS - one-third of the total 90 ECTS required for the award of the Master’s degree. It takes place over the summer following the completion of the taught modules (for exact IRP dates, see Important dates , and for the curriculum, see MSc curriculum ). Upon successful completion of the IRP, students should be able to: Develop a computational solution from scratch, substantially extend the capabilities of an existing code, or build a model to analyse and interpret a substantial dataset. Contribute to an active research field or a commercial project. Creatively and critically employ techniques to solve open-ended, real-world, challenging problems. Effectively communicate their work by writing reports and defending it under critical questioning. Project requirements # The projects can come from different fields. For instance, in previous years, students worked on computational research and commercial projects in environmental science, geoscience and engineering, fundamental and applied physics, mathematics, chemistry, healthcare, finance, computer science, climate modelling, and many others. However, all projects must be computational and include a substantial coding component to address a relevant research question or tackle a commercial challenge. Specifically, a student is expected to either: Develop from scratch a simulation code, data processing or analysis pipeline, or machine learning model, to address a non-trivial problem involving a complex system, numerical model, or substantial dataset. OR Substantially extend or enhance an existing simulation codebase, data processing or analysis pipeline, or machine learning framework, and apply it to a substantial dataset or computational problem, for example by improving model performance, adding new components, or broadening applicability. Note For the ACSE and EDSML MSc courses, the projects can come from any field . On the other hand, for the GEMS MSc course, the project must address a geoscience and engineering problem . We also suggest referring to the marking criteria section in Marking criteria for an overview of what examiners are expected to evaluate. Collaboration and teamwork # Multiple students may work on the same project topic, either as part of a coordinated team effort or through parallel but related investigations. In such cases, students can collaborate by working on individual components of a larger project, or by tackling the same problem using different approaches or methodologies. Collaboration between students is encouraged; however, each student submits their own written reports and code, and it must be unambiguous from the submitted work what their contribution is. For further guidance on acceptable collaboration practices and attribution, please see the Academic Integrity and Misconduct .

It may differ from the original title approved at the start of the IRP, and you are allowed to refine or update it between the project plan and the final report. Tip You are welcome to include additional individuals on the title page as supervisors if you wish to acknowledge their support or contribution to your learning. These individuals do not need to be officially listed in the IRP records, and you do not need prior approval from the IRP Team to include them. This is particularly important to ensure that everyone who supported your work — such as PhD students or postdocs — is given the credit they deserve. Formatting # You are free to format your project plan and final report in a style of your choosing.

Key principles include using clear fonts, sufficient line spacing, meaningful headings, left-aligned text, and avoiding dense blocks of text or excessive italics and underlining. Similarly, to ensure your figures are accessible to all readers, use high-contrast colour schemes, large and legible text, and clear legends. Avoid relying solely on colour to convey meaning — use patterns, textures, labels, or symbols where appropriate.

Engaging with Supervisors and Documenting Meetings logbook.md An example of a logbook entry Academic Integrity and Misconduct # Academic integrity is essential to conducting research, earning a credible degree, and maintaining trust and reputation. Your work must be your own, properly attributed, and honestly reported. As postgraduate taught students working on your Independent Research Project (IRP), you are expected to demonstrate the highest standards of integrity, honesty, rigour, and accountability in every aspect of your work — including code development, written and oral dissemination, and all forms of communication with supervisors, staff, peers, external partners, and the wider public. Academic misconduct is taken very seriously and may lead to severe consequences, including failure of the module or termination of your degree programme. An academic misconduct investigation can be initiated at any time, even after graduation, if concerns about the authenticity or integrity of submitted work come to light. In addition to the university-wide academic integrity and misconduct policies, such as Academic Misconduct Policy and Procedure Guidance on Academic Integrity in Examinations and Assessments , here, we set the IRP-specific rules and expectations. You are responsible for understanding and adhering to all of them. A lack of familiarity with these requirements will not be accepted as a justification in cases of suspected academic misconduct. These policies include both university-wide regulations and module-specific rules and expectations that are non-negotiable. While students are encouraged to discuss these with their supervisors to better understand how to adhere to them in their specific projects, supervisors cannot override, modify, or make exceptions to these rules. 1. Academic Integrity Declaration # To establish rules and expectations around academic integrity for the Independent Research Project (IRP), all students are required to familiarise themselves with and submit an Academic Integrity Declaration: (Imperial login required) Academic Integrity Declaration (Publicly accessible) Academic Integrity Declaration This online form must be submitted twice during the IRP : once with your Project Plan and once with your Final Report and Code. The form must be submitted before the deadline for each deliverable, and submission is mandatory. It serves as your formal confirmation that you understand and agree to follow the IRP-specific academic integrity policies. By submitting the form, you confirm that you have read, understood, and will abide by all rules outlined. Failure to submit the form, make accurate disclosures, or comply with these rules and expectations may result in a formal academic misconduct investigation. The declaration covers several critical areas, such as: An explicit prohibition on the use of generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Bard, Claude, Scribbr) in any aspect of the preparation of written reports — including drafting, rewriting, rephrasing, correcting grammar or spelling, expanding content, or generating ideas or illustrations. The written reports must be entirely your own work, expressed in your own words and reasoning. By “written reports,” we mean the project plan and final report only, as described in the Deliverables section. A commitment to fully disclose any use of generative AI tools at any stage of the IRP - including code development, debugging, testing, planning, optimisation, documentation, packaging, or research. You must clearly identify each tool used and explicitly state which parts of your work were generated or influenced by it. A commitment that all submitted work reflects your personal knowledge, understanding, and technical skills. Any use of resources - including websites, open-source code, examples, published articles in scientific journals, news articles, pre-prints (e.g. in arXiv or institutional repositories), books, or AI-generated suggestions - must be properly cited.

All students are responsible for understanding and adhering to all of them. A lack of familiarity with these requirements will not be accepted as a justification in cases of suspected academic misconduct. Independent Research Project (IRP) is the capstone module in the Ada Lovelace Academy at Imperial College London for the following MSc courses: Applied Computational Science and Engineering (ACSE) Environmental Data Science and Machine Learning (EDSML) Geo-Energy with Machine Learning and Data Science (GEMS) It allows students to work independently to address a relevant real-world research question or tackle a commercial challenge by designing and implementing a computational solution . It is worth 30 ECTS - one-third of the total 90 ECTS required for the award of the Master’s degree. It takes place over the summer following the completion of the taught modules (for exact IRP dates, see Important dates , and for the curriculum, see MSc curriculum ). Upon successful completion of the IRP, students should be able to: Develop a computational solution from scratch, substantially extend the capabilities of an existing code, or build a model to analyse and interpret a substantial dataset. Contribute to an active research field or a commercial project. Creatively and critically employ techniques to solve open-ended, real-world, challenging problems. Effectively communicate their work by writing reports and defending it under critical questioning. Project requirements # The projects can come from different fields. For instance, in previous years, students worked on computational research and commercial projects in environmental science, geoscience and engineering, fundamental and applied physics, mathematics, chemistry, healthcare, finance, computer science, climate modelling, and many others. However, all projects must be computational and include a substantial coding component to address a relevant research question or tackle a commercial challenge. Specifically, a student is expected to either: Develop from scratch a simulation code, data processing or analysis pipeline, or machine learning model, to address a non-trivial problem involving a complex system, numerical model, or substantial dataset. OR Substantially extend or enhance an existing simulation codebase, data processing or analysis pipeline, or machine learning framework, and apply it to a substantial dataset or computational problem, for example by improving model performance, adding new components, or broadening applicability. Note For the ACSE and EDSML MSc courses, the projects can come from any field . On the other hand, for the GEMS MSc course, the project must address a geoscience and engineering problem . We also suggest referring to the marking criteria section in Marking criteria for an overview of what examiners are expected to evaluate. Collaboration and teamwork # Multiple students may work on the same project topic, either as part of a coordinated team effort or through parallel but related investigations. In such cases, students can collaborate by working on individual components of a larger project, or by tackling the same problem using different approaches or methodologies. Collaboration between students is encouraged; however, each student submits their own written reports and code, and it must be unambiguous from the submitted work what their contribution is. For further guidance on acceptable collaboration practices and attribution, please see the Academic Integrity and Misconduct .

The information on this site is designed to augment GitHub’s official documentation with Imperial specific best practices and recommendations. It’s not designed to be a step-by-step walkthrough of how to perform specific tasks in GitHub. For this you can use the official documentation. If you’ve got a particular topic you’d like to see covered or you’ve got a suggestion on how we can improve this documentation, please create a new issue under the repository issues tab . Please note, you’ll need to be a member of the Imperial College London organisation to do this. What is GitHub? GitHub is a developer platform used by over 100+ million developers and 4+ million organisations to build, scale, and deliver secure software. It uses the open-source tool Git to provide distributed version control, allowing multiple people to collaborate on code at the same time. It offers both public and private repositories for users to store their code and access GitHub features. Anyone can create an account on GitHub.com free of charge and create repositories under their GitHub account. Imperial has an enterprise license for GitHub, meaning you can link your Imperial account to access resources in the Imperial College London organisation on GitHub. This is a private space where our staff and students can collaborate on projects. Imperial has two versions of GitHub Enterprise - GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server. GitHub Enterprise Cloud GitHub Enterprise Cloud (recommended version) is a cloud-based service that sits on top of GitHub.com and provides advanced features for enterprises. To access the Imperial College London organisation on GitHub.com, you need an Imperial account. If you need to collaborate with users who do not have an Imperial account, you can add them as an outside collaborator to the repository. On GitHub Enterprise Cloud, users can create public repositories (anyone has read access and can suggest changes), internal repositories (anyone at Imperial has read access and can suggest changes) or private repositories (access must be explicitly granted). More information on repositories can be found on the repositories page . GitHub Enterprise Server GitHub Enterprise Server is hosted on-premises and is therefore not accessible on the public internet. All data is stored on-premises and you’ll need an Imperial account to login. This version of GitHub isn’t highly available, requires regular downtime for maintenance and doesn’t include all the functionality of GitHub Enterprise Cloud. Therefore, we recommend GitHub Enterprise Cloud for the majority of use-cases. GitHub Enterprise Server should only be used if you cannot store your source code in the cloud, for example, you may have a research grant that stipulates code must be stored on-premises. FAQ What does Imperial’s GitHub License include? Imperial has an enterprise license with GitHub which entitles you to the following: Access to GitHub Enterprise Cloud with unlimited public and private repositories. Usage of GitHub Actions in private repositories. GitHub Actions is free for public repositories. Please try to avoid using MacOS runners with GitHub Actions as these incur additional costs. Usage of GitHub Packages in private repositories. GitHub Packages is free for public repositories. Additional security measures for private repositories such as branch protection rules, code owners/reviews and environment protection rules. Access to GitHub Enterprise Server, an on-premises version of GitHub that can be used when research grants/contracts stipulate source code must be stored on-premises. Please note that some of the features above are only applicable to the cloud version of GitHub Enterprise. You can find a full list of the features on the GitHub Pricing webpage . How do I gain access to GitHub Enterprise Cloud? Create an account on GitHub.com if you don’t already have one. We recommend you use your personal email address so you can continue to access the account if you leave Imperial. Follow the instructions gaining access to the Imperial College London organisation article . Once you’ve completed these steps, you’ll be added as a member and will have access to all the resources. How do I gain access to GitHub Enterprise Server? Visit the Imperial GitHub organisation and login with your Imperial username and password. Once logged in, you can create repositories under your personal account or ask an organisation owner to add you to their organisation. By default, you’ll also be added to the main Imperial College London organisation (this may take 10-20 minutes) where you can create repositories and store your code. GitHub Enterprise Server s"

For more information, see Deliverables . Computing resources For more information on computing resources available to students, see Computing Resources . IRP-specific Academic Integrity Rules and Expectations IRP-specific rules and expectations around academic integrity are in Academic Integrity and Misconduct . All students are responsible for understanding and adhering to all of them. A lack of familiarity with these requirements will not be accepted as a justification in cases of suspected academic misconduct. Independent Research Project (IRP) is the capstone module in the Ada Lovelace Academy at Imperial College London for the following MSc courses: Applied Computational Science and Engineering (ACSE) Environmental Data Science and Machine Learning (EDSML) Geo-Energy with Machine Learning and Data Science (GEMS) It allows students to work independently to address a relevant real-world research question or tackle a commercial challenge by designing and implementing a computational solution . It is worth 30 ECTS - one-third of the total 90 ECTS required for the award of the Master’s degree. It takes place over the summer following the completion of the taught modules (for exact IRP dates, see Important dates , and for the curriculum, see MSc curriculum ). Upon successful completion of the IRP, students should be able to: Develop a computational solution from scratch, substantially extend the capabilities of an existing code, or build a model to analyse and interpret a substantial dataset. Contribute to an active research field or a commercial project. Creatively and critically employ techniques to solve open-ended, real-world, challenging problems. Effectively communicate their work by writing reports and defending it under critical questioning. Project requirements # The projects can come from different fields. For instance, in previous years, students worked on computational research and commercial projects in environmental science, geoscience and engineering, fundamental and applied physics, mathematics, chemistry, healthcare, finance, computer science, climate modelling, and many others. However, all projects must be computational and include a substantial coding component to address a relevant research question or tackle a commercial challenge. Specifically, a student is expected to either: Develop from scratch a simulation code, data processing or analysis pipeline, or machine learning model, to address a non-trivial problem involving a complex system, numerical model, or substantial dataset. OR Substantially extend or enhance an existing simulation codebase, data processing or analysis pipeline, or machine learning framework, and apply it to a substantial dataset or computational problem, for example by improving model performance, adding new components, or broadening applicability. Note For the ACSE and EDSML MSc courses, the projects can come from any field . On the other hand, for the GEMS MSc course, the project must address a geoscience and engineering problem . We also suggest referring to the marking criteria section in Marking criteria for an overview of what examiners are expected to evaluate. Collaboration and teamwork # Multiple students may work on the same project topic, either as part of a coordinated team effort or through parallel but related investigations. In such cases, students can collaborate by working on individual components of a larger project, or by tackling the same problem using different approaches or methodologies. Collaboration between students is encouraged; however, each student submits their own written reports and code, and it must be unambiguous from the submitted work what their contribution is. For further guidance on acceptable collaboration practices and attribution, please see the Academic Integrity and Misconduct .

Final Report and Code # Distinction (70-100%) # A project has sufficient quality and originality to be publishable as it stands or with minor modifications to its scientific content, but potentially with substantial improvements required to improve phrasing, spelling, or grammar. The work demonstrates new insights into the topic with an innovative approach, carried out diligently and professionally. It shows significant breadth and depth with sound background research, an exemplary implementation, and a well-structured and well-presented report with the project’s background, objectives, and achievements. It largely or wholly overcomes significant technical problems. 90 - 100% # Outstanding deliverables, making an original contribution by questioning or challenging prevailing paradigms, offering new insights informed by critical evaluation of current research practice, and clearly demonstrating innovative/creative thinking.

For external IRPs , any intellectual property arrangements must be agreed directly between the student and the external organisation . We cannot act as an intermediary and do not provide legal advice or support in negotiating or interpreting these agreements. It is the responsibility of both the student and the external organisation to ensure that IP terms are clear, understood, and in place before the IRP begins. Section 2.2 of the Intellectual Property Policy is especially relevant for students working on internal IRPs. It states: Section 2.2 – Students Where students generate IP in the course of their study or research they will own that IP in their own right unless one of the following applies: (i) they generate IP which is subject to governing terms or an agreement with an external organisation whereby the IP vests with College or a third party; (ii) they generate IP which builds upon existing IP generated by College Employees or Associates; (iii) they generate IP jointly with College Employees or Associates; or (iv) they are, or have the status of, College Employee (in which case they are treated by College and the law as employees). In the above listed circumstances, students will be required to assign IP to College and, in respect of revenue generated by that IP, the student will be treated on the same basis as College Employees under the Reward to Inventors Scheme.

Agreements Between the Student and External Organisation # If an external organisation wishes to set up a formal agreement directly with a student — for example, an NDA, internship agreement, or contract — it is their responsibility to arrange this directly with the student. We cannot sign any documents on behalf of students and does not act as an intermediary in these arrangements. Students are solely responsible for reviewing and understanding the content of any documents they are asked to sign. We cannot provide legal advice or templates for such agreements. If students have concerns about the terms they are being asked to agree to, they must seek independent guidance. It is also the responsibility of both the student and the external organisation to ensure that all necessary documentation is fully completed, agreed upon, and in place before the IRP begins. Delays in preparing or processing these documents may impact the project timeline, and in some cases, the student may be unable to undertake the project at all. Documents Signed by the Department and External Organisation # External organisations or students wishing to have a document reviewed and signed by the department — whether an NDA or another formal agreement — must send it to Thomas Dray at t.dray@imperial.ac.uk . Thomas coordinates the review process and arranges for signatures where appropriate. Sufficient time should always be allowed for the department to review and process any document. Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) # In cases where the external IRP includes confidential information, the department may agree to sign an NDA covering all relevant staff involved in supervision and assessment. This allows access to the student’s written report and, ideally, their code, which is required for supervision and marking. The department will only consider signing such an NDA after the student has been formally allocated to the project. When an NDA is in place, viva examinations will be held privately, and student’s work will not be made publicly available. However, this NDA applies only to department staff. If the external partner requires the student to be bound by the same or similar terms, the student must sign a separate agreement directly with the external organisation . Sharing Code with the Department # We understand that it is sometimes a requirement from external organisations for the student to work within a private code repository hosted by the company. If confidentiality requirements prevent code from being submitted to the student’s IRP GitHub repository, the student and both supervisors must agree on an alternative method for granting the internal supervisor access to the code . While we leave it up to the student and their supervisors to decide what method works best, it is essential that the internal (second) supervisor is sufficiently satisfied that they can evaluate the student’s work, confirm that the work was done by the student, and that the report accurately reflects their contribution. Some of the possible approaches that can be considered include: If permitted by the external organisation, the internal supervisor may be granted access to the private repository for limited time where the code is hosted. The student and the internal supervisor can arrange a meeting where the student demonstrates the code and answers questions. For example, by sharing their screen so that no code transfer takes place. If the student was contributing to an existing codebase in a private repository owned by an external organisation, the student may transfer the most significant and original contributions they made into their IRP GitHub repository, so that no pre-existing codebase is shared. Since all written reports are already accessible to the department (and are covered under the NDA if one is in place), the student may include the most important code snippets, such as functions or classes they developed in the appendix of their final report. Please avoid including the entire codebase. The appendix is not included in the word count. When the code i"

The user documentation for Imperial’s HPC can be found in the RCS User Guide . A variety of helpful tips for using RCS resources and related tools and services can be found here . For a fairly comprehensive introduction to the HPC capabilities at Imperial, please refer to the Presentation by Katerina Michalickova. Departmental GPU resources # The Department of Earth Science and Engineering offers restricted access to its departmental cluster, which currently includes 16 Nvidia A100 40GB GPUs, with 2 more nodes expected to be available by December 2025. While the Imperial HPC facilities and your laptop will likely meet most requirements, should you present a compelling case for utilising the departmental GPU cluster, you can submit a request for review. To ask for access, please: Discuss your needs with your main supervisor, who will assess whether the departmental GPU cluster is necessary for your project. If your main supervisor agrees that you need access to the departmental GPU cluster, submit a request for review to Marijan Beg and CC your main supervisor. Please ensure you include a brief justification for your request, explaining in particular why the Imperial HPC facilities and your laptop are insufficient for your project. After Marijan reviews your request, he will forward it to the computing team. Please note that the computing team needs at least a week’s notice before providing you access once your request is approved. Other resources # If your IRP demands require anything other than the aforementioned resources, please communicate your specific needs to your main supervisor as soon as possible. For instance, if you require access to one or more desktops or workstations, if you need any specialist hardware, software, or cloud resources, it must be discussed with your main supervisor, and they will discuss it with the computing team at the earliest opportunity. The computing team will require a reasonable amount of notice to respond to these requests. Hardware # There is a limited stock of spare desktops and workstations that can be used for the IRP. Some customisation options are available, but the computing team may not be able to accommodate all requests. Please give at least a week’s notice if you require access to a standard desktop (i7 CPU and 16 GB of RAM). (Please specify Windows / Linux and version) Please give at least a month’s notice if you need anything more than a standard desktop. Please specify the minimum and recommended CPU, GPU, RAM and disk, and the computing team will do their best to match these. They cannot put more than 128 GB of RAM in a machine, and GPU choice is limited to older 2-4 GB cards. Be aware it may not be possible to accommodate the request. Software # Please give at least a couple of days’ notice if you need specialist software that the department already has access to. (Your supervisor will be aware of any relevant software and whether it is something we usually have access to.) Please give at least a month’s notice if we do not have the software. Be aware it may"

Engaging with Supervisors and Documenting Meetings logbook.md An example of a logbook entry Academic Integrity and Misconduct # Academic integrity is essential to conducting research, earning a credible degree, and maintaining trust and reputation. Your work must be your own, properly attributed, and honestly reported. As postgraduate taught students working on your Independent Research Project (IRP), you are expected to demonstrate the highest standards of integrity, honesty, rigour, and accountability in every aspect of your work — including code development, written and oral dissemination, and all forms of communication with supervisors, staff, peers, external partners, and the wider public. Academic misconduct is taken very seriously and may lead to severe consequences, including failure of the module or termination of your degree programme. An academic misconduct investigation can be initiated at any time, even after graduation, if concerns about the authenticity or integrity of submitted work come to light. In addition to the university-wide academic integrity and misconduct policies, such as Academic Misconduct Policy and Procedure Guidance on Academic Integrity in Examinations and Assessments , here, we set the IRP-specific rules and expectations. You are responsible for understanding and adhering to all of them. A lack of familiarity with these requirements will not be accepted as a justification in cases of suspected academic misconduct. These policies include both university-wide regulations and module-specific rules and expectations that are non-negotiable. While students are encouraged to discuss these with their supervisors to better understand how to adhere to them in their specific projects, supervisors cannot override, modify, or make exceptions to these rules. 1. Academic Integrity Declaration # To establish rules and expectations around academic integrity for the Independent Research Project (IRP), all students are required to familiarise themselves with and submit an Academic Integrity Declaration: (Imperial login required) Academic Integrity Declaration (Publicly accessible) Academic Integrity Declaration This online form must be submitted twice during the IRP : once with your Project Plan and once with your Final Report and Code. The form must be submitted before the deadline for each deliverable, and submission is mandatory. It serves as your formal confirmation that you understand and agree to follow the IRP-specific academic integrity policies. By submitting the form, you confirm that you have read, understood, and will abide by all rules outlined. Failure to submit the form, make accurate disclosures, or comply with these rules and expectations may result in a formal academic misconduct investigation. The declaration covers several critical areas, such as: An explicit prohibition on the use of generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Bard, Claude, Scribbr) in any aspect of the preparation of written reports — including drafting, rewriting, rephrasing, correcting grammar or spelling, expanding content, or generating ideas or illustrations. The written reports must be entirely your own work, expressed in your own words and reasoning. By “written reports,” we mean the project plan and final report only, as described in the Deliverables section. A commitment to fully disclose any use of generative AI tools at any stage of the IRP - including code development, debugging, testing, planning, optimisation, documentation, packaging, or research. You must clearly identify each tool used and explicitly state which parts of your work were generated or influenced by it. A commitment that all submitted work reflects your personal knowledge, understanding, and technical skills. Any use of resources - including websites, open-source code, examples, published articles in scientific journals, news articles, pre-prints (e.g. in arXiv or institutional repositories), books, or AI-generated suggestions - must be properly cited. A strict ban on outsourcing any part of the IRP to third parties. All submitted work must be your own and must not have been previously submitted for assessment (no self-plagiarism). All submitted work must be developed during the official IRP period — between the designated start and end IRP dates. You may not rec"

Academic Integrity Declaration # All students must submit an Academic Integrity Declaration twice during the IRP: once with your Project Plan and once with your Final Report and Code. The form must be submitted before the deadline for each deliverable. For further information refer to Academic Integrity and Misconduct . We strongly advise all students to familiarise themselves well in advance with the IRP module-specific academic integrity rules and expectations. This includes the complete ban on the use of generative AI tools in preparing written reports. Written Reports # As part of the Independent Research Project (IRP), students are required to submit two written reports: Project Plan Final Report Both reports are mandatory and must be submitted in order to successfully complete the IRP. Submission is not optional, and failure to submit either report will result in an incomplete assessment of the module. Title page # The first page of the project plan and the final report must include the following information: university, department, MSc course, student’s name, submission date, project title, GitHub IRP repository link, and the supervisors. Example Word and LaTeX title page templates are provided in the template repository . These templates are provided as guidance - you are free to design your own title page, provided that all required information is included and clearly presented. Tip Your title should be concise, specific, and descriptive — clearly indicating the focus of your project. It may differ from the original title approved at the start of the IRP, and you are allowed to refine or update it between the project plan and the final report. Tip You are welcome to include additional individuals on the title page as supervisors if you wish to acknowledge their support or contribution to your learning. These individuals do not need to be officially listed in the IRP records, and you do not need prior approval from the IRP Team to include them. This is particularly important to ensure that everyone who supported your work — such as PhD students or postdocs — is given the credit they deserve. Formatting # You are free to format your project plan and final report in a style of your choosing. However, we strongly recommend that you follow the Style Guide published by the British Dyslexia Association . This guide promotes inclusive and accessible document design, helping ensure that your work is easy to read and navigate for all audiences — including examiners, moderators, and peers with visual impairments or learning differences. Key principles include using clear fonts, sufficient line spacing, meaningful headings, left-aligned text, and avoiding dense blocks of text or excessive italics and underlining. Similarly, to ensure your figures are accessible to all readers, use high-contrast colour schemes, large and legible text, and clear legends. Avoid relying solely on colour to convey meaning — use patterns, textures, labels, or symbols where appropriate. For more guidance, see Dos and Don’ts on Designing for Accessibility – GOV.UK Data Visualizations, Charts, and Graphs – Digital Accessibility by Harvard . Length and file size limits # The written reports for the IRP must adhere to the following limits: written report word limit figure + table limit max PDF file size Project plan 1,500 5 4 MB Final report 5,000 10 8 MB Reports that are shorter than the stated limits will not be penalised. A small (max. 5%) tolerance is allowed to account for variation between word-counting tools.

Independent Research Project (IRP) is the capstone module in the Ada Lovelace Academy at Imperial College London for the following MSc courses: Applied Computational Science and Engineering (ACSE) Environmental Data Science and Machine Learning (EDSML) Geo-Energy with Machine Learning and Data Science (GEMS) It allows students to work independently to address a relevant real-world research question or tackle a commercial challenge by designing and implementing a computational solution . It is worth 30 ECTS - one-third of the total 90 ECTS required for the award of the Master’s degree. It takes place over the summer following the completion of the taught modules (for exact IRP dates, see Important dates , and for the curriculum, see MSc curriculum ). Upon successful completion of the IRP, students should be able to: Develop a computational solution from scratch, substantially extend the capabilities of an existing code, or build a model to analyse and interpret a substantial dataset. Contribute to an active research field or a commercial project. Creatively and critically employ techniques to solve open-ended, real-world, challenging problems. Effectively communicate their work by writing reports and defending it under critical questioning. Project requirements # The projects can come from different fields. For instance, in previous years, students worked on computational research and commercial projects in environmental science, geoscience and engineering, fundamental and applied physics, mathematics, chemistry, healthcare, finance, computer science, climate modelling, and many others. However, all projects must be computational and include a substantial coding component to address a relevant research question or tackle a commercial challenge. Specifically, a student is expected to either: Develop from scratch a simulation code, data processing or analysis pipeline, or machine learning model, to address a non-trivial problem involving a complex system, numerical model, or substantial dataset. OR Substantially extend or enhance an existing simulation codebase, data processing or analysis pipeline, or machine learning framework, and apply it to a substantial dataset or computational problem, for example by improving model performance, adding new components, or broadening applicability. Note For the ACSE and EDSML MSc courses, the projects can come from any field . On the other hand, for the GEMS MSc course, the project must address a geoscience and engineering problem . We also suggest referring to the marking criteria section in Marking criteria for an overview of what examiners are expected to evaluate. Collaboration and teamwork # Multiple students may work on the same project topic, either as part of a coordinated team effort or through parallel but related investigations. In such cases, students can collaborate by working on individual components of a larger project, or by tackling the same problem using different approaches or methodologies. Collaboration between students is encouraged; however, each student submits their own written reports and code, and it must be unambiguous from the submitted work what their contribution is. For further guidance on acceptable collaboration practices and attribution, please see the Academic Integrity and Misconduct .

Collaboration and teamwork # Multiple students may work on the same project topic, either as part of a coordinated team effort or through parallel but related investigations. In such cases, students can collaborate by working on individual components of a larger project, or by tackling the same problem using different approaches or methodologies. Collaboration between students is encouraged; however, each student submits their own written reports and code, and it must be unambiguous from the submitted work what their contribution is. For further guidance on acceptable collaboration practices and attribution, please see the Academic Integrity and Misconduct .

He describes the world enclosed beneath the canopy—often as tall as 200 feet—as “enchanting,” with “an amazing diversity of life bustling around at your fingertips.” The forest is right outside a major metropolis, but few know of this ecosystem that supports more than 700 species because … it’s a giant kelp forest. Composed of undulating seaweeds, which serve as structural and biological supports, carbon sinks, foraging grounds, and nurseries, this vanishing biodiversity hotspot is invisible to most of its human neighbors. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . “You can crawl through the forest, you can swim through the forest, you can just lay at the bottom and stare up at the surface and watch the sun play off the seaweeds,” says Eger, a marine ecologist and program director of the Kelp Forest Alliance, a global environmental organization that aims to protect kelp forests. He’s been speaking to me at length about his work in kelp research and conservation, but this is the first time I’ve heard an edge of reverence in his voice on our video call. The thought of an old growth forest being felled can tug at one’s emotions, but few of us have likely ever given much thought to vast canopies of seaweed, despite the fact that the benefits they provide to both natural and human communities are on par with the most productive terrestrial forests on Earth. Just as tree forests grow on approximately a third of the Earth’s landmass, so do kelp forests cover a third of the world’s coastal shallows. Suddenly, as I listen to Eger speak, I’m tempted to seek one out. “The Western mindset has been groomed to think of the waters as an alien force, a dark void.” ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . He is used to such reactions. “I try to encourage other people to go [to kelp forests], change that perception, get it a bit more commonplace,” Eger says. Kelp forests are one of many threatened or endangered marine ecosystems that suffer not only from a visibility problem, but also from a relationship problem. The Earth is about 71 percent water, and 40 percent of the world’s population lives within 60 miles of a coast . But to many of us—especially in the Global North, which dominates decision-making that impacts the planet the most—ocean spaces remain abstract, difficult to define, and hard to access, both physically and emotionally. “At a deeper cultural level, the Western mindset has been groomed to think of the waters as an alien force, a dark void, a theater of chaos,” writes the social theorist Jeremy Rifkin in his book Planet Aqua: Rethinking Our Home in the Universe . The frequently made—if not entirely accurate—point that we know more about the surface of the moon than the bottom of our own oceans, isn’t helping the cause. Some scientists are now arguing that the widespread cultural notion of the ocean as a vast and mysterious entity has become a serious hindrance to applied marine research that seeks to protect the oceans and mitigate climate change.

The information on this site is designed to augment GitHub’s official documentation with Imperial specific best practices and recommendations. It’s not designed to be a step-by-step walkthrough of how to perform specific tasks in GitHub. For this you can use the official documentation. If you’ve got a particular topic you’d like to see covered or you’ve got a suggestion on how we can improve this documentation, please create a new issue under the repository issues tab . Please note, you’ll need to be a member of the Imperial College London organisation to do this. What is GitHub? GitHub is a developer platform used by over 100+ million developers and 4+ million organisations to build, scale, and deliver secure software. It uses the open-source tool Git to provide distributed version control, allowing multiple people to collaborate on code at the same time. It offers both public and private repositories for users to store their code and access GitHub features. Anyone can create an account on GitHub.com free of charge and create repositories under their GitHub account. Imperial has an enterprise license for GitHub, meaning you can link your Imperial account to access resources in the Imperial College London organisation on GitHub. This is a private space where our staff and students can collaborate on projects. Imperial has two versions of GitHub Enterprise - GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server. GitHub Enterprise Cloud GitHub Enterprise Cloud (recommended version) is a cloud-based service that sits on top of GitHub.com and provides advanced features for enterprises. To access the Imperial College London organisation on GitHub.com, you need an Imperial account. If you need to collaborate with users who do not have an Imperial account, you can add them as an outside collaborator to the repository. On GitHub Enterprise Cloud, users can create public repositories (anyone has read access and can suggest changes), internal repositories (anyone at Imperial has read access and can suggest changes) or private repositories (access must be explicitly granted). More information on repositories can be found on the repositories page . GitHub Enterprise Server GitHub Enterprise Server is hosted on-premises and is therefore not accessible on the public internet. All data is stored on-premises and you’ll need an Imperial account to login. This version of GitHub isn’t highly available, requires regular downtime for maintenance and doesn’t include all the functionality of GitHub Enterprise Cloud. Therefore, we recommend GitHub Enterprise Cloud for the majority of use-cases. GitHub Enterprise Server should only be used if you cannot store your source code in the cloud, for example, you may have a research grant that stipulates code must be stored on-premises. FAQ What does Imperial’s GitHub License include? Imperial has an enterprise license with GitHub which entitles you to the following: Access to GitHub Enterprise Cloud with unlimited public and private repositories. Usage of GitHub Actions in private repositories. GitHub Actions is free for public repositories. Please try to avoid using MacOS runners with GitHub Actions as these incur additional costs. Usage of GitHub Packages in private repositories. GitHub Packages is free for public repositories. Additional security measures for private repositories such as branch protection rules, code owners/reviews and environment protection rules. Access to GitHub Enterprise Server, an on-premises version of GitHub that can be used when research grants/contracts stipulate source code must be stored on-premises. Please note that some of the features above are only applicable to the cloud version of GitHub Enterprise. You can find a full list of the features on the GitHub Pricing webpage . How do I gain access to GitHub Enterprise Cloud? Create an account on GitHub.com if you don’t already have one. We recommend you use your personal email address so you can continue to access the account if you leave Imperial. Follow the instructions gaining access to the Imperial College London organisation article . Once you’ve completed these steps, you’ll be added as a member and will have access to all the resources. How do I gain access to GitHub Enterprise Server? Visit the Imperial GitHub organisation and login with your Imperial username and password. Once logged in, you can create repositories under your personal account or ask an organisation owner to add you to their organisation.

The information on this site is designed to augment GitHub’s official documentation with Imperial specific best practices and recommendations. It’s not designed to be a step-by-step walkthrough of how to perform specific tasks in GitHub. For this you can use the official documentation. If you’ve got a particular topic you’d like to see covered or you’ve got a suggestion on how we can improve this documentation, please create a new issue under the repository issues tab . Please note, you’ll need to be a member of the Imperial College London organisation to do this. What is GitHub? GitHub is a developer platform used by over 100+ million developers and 4+ million organisations to build, scale, and deliver secure software. It uses the open-source tool Git to provide distributed version control, allowing multiple people to collaborate on code at the same time. It offers both public and private repositories for users to store their code and access GitHub features. Anyone can create an account on GitHub.com free of charge and create repositories under their GitHub account. Imperial has an enterprise license for GitHub, meaning you can link your Imperial account to access resources in the Imperial College London organisation on GitHub. This is a private space where our staff and students can collaborate on projects. Imperial has two versions of GitHub Enterprise - GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server. GitHub Enterprise Cloud GitHub Enterprise Cloud (recommended version) is a cloud-based service that sits on top of GitHub.com and provides advanced features for enterprises. To access the Imperial College London organisation on GitHub.com, you need an Imperial account. If you need to collaborate with users who do not have an Imperial account, you can add them as an outside collaborator to the repository. On GitHub Enterprise Cloud, users can create public repositories (anyone has read access and can suggest changes), internal repositories (anyone at Imperial has read access and can suggest changes) or private repositories (access must be explicitly granted). More information on repositories can be found on the repositories page . GitHub Enterprise Server GitHub Enterprise Server is hosted on-premises and is therefore not accessible on the public internet. All data is stored on-premises and you’ll need an Imperial account to login. This version of GitHub isn’t highly available, requires regular downtime for maintenance and doesn’t include all the functionality of GitHub Enterprise Cloud. Therefore, we recommend GitHub Enterprise Cloud for the majority of use-cases. GitHub Enterprise Server should only be used if you cannot store your source code in the cloud, for example, you may have a research grant that stipulates code must be stored on-premises. FAQ What does Imperial’s GitHub License include? Imperial has an enterprise license with GitHub which entitles you to the following: Access to GitHub Enterprise Cloud with unlimited public and private repositories. Usage of GitHub Actions in private repositories. GitHub Actions is free for public repositories. Please try to avoid using MacOS runners with GitHub Actions as these incur additional costs. Usage of GitHub Packages in private repositories. GitHub Packages is free for public repositories. Additional security measures for private repositories such as branch protection rules, code owners/reviews and environment protection rules. Access to GitHub Enterprise Server, an on-premises version of GitHub that can be used when research grants/contracts stipulate source code must be stored on-premises. Please note that some of the features above are only applicable to the cloud version of GitHub Enterprise. You can find a full list of the features on the GitHub Pricing webpage . How do I gain access to GitHub Enterprise Cloud? Create an account on GitHub.com if you don’t already have one. We recommend you use your personal email address so you can continue to access the account if you leave Imperial. Follow the instructions gaining access to the Imperial College London organisation article . Once you’ve completed these steps, you’ll be added as a member and will have access to all the resources. How do I gain access to GitHub Enterprise Server? Visit the Imperial GitHub organisation and login with your Imperial username and password. Once logged in, you can create repositories under your personal account or ask an organisation owner to add you to their organisation. By default, you’ll also be added to the main Imperial College London organisation (this may take 10-20 minutes) where you can create repositories and store your code. GitHub Enterprise Server s"

I've seen people stopping a skateboard by just putting the foot on the ground and letting it slide on the road. I can't do that on my cruiser. It may also be due to my height but board is too tall for me to just put the foot on the road. To specify, I'd like to know a way to stop when going really fast down the hill.  I've seen people stopping with the tail too, but I'm scared I will just fall when it's too fast. Any safe methods? Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.

Calculate What is your BMR? Your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is an estimate of how many calories you'd burn if you were to do nothing but rest for 24 hours. It represents the minimum amount of energy needed to keep your body functioning, including breathing and keeping your heart beating. Your BMR does not include the calories you burn from normal daily activities or exercise. Our calculator uses the Mifflin-St. Jeor equations to estimate your BMR which is believed to be more accurate than the more commonly used Harris-Benedict equation.

Get to grips with your metabolism Your body uses energy, even while you’re sleeping, and this energy needs to be replenished through eating for the body to survive. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum number of calories your body needs to maintain those basic, life-sustaining functions such as breathing, digestion, and blood flow. It is, in essence, your metabolism. Our BMR calculator can help you determine how many calories you want to burn or consume based on your BMR score, exercise routine and health goals, as well as giving you a better understanding of your body. JavaScript is required to use this calculator, but is not currently available; please try again. Health Insurance Our health insurance comes with added wellbeing benefits - helping you manage your BMR and live well today. Get a quote Explore health insurance How is BMR calculated? We’ve used the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, which calculates BMR as follows: Men : (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5 Women : (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161 So, a 40 year old female who stands 5’5’’ (165.1cm) and weighs 135.1 lbs (61.3kg) would have a BMR of 1300kcal , which is the minimum number of calories she would need to eat in a day to maintain her weight.

Related Body Fat Calculator | Calorie Calculator The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy needed while resting in a temperate environment when the digestive system is inactive. It is the equivalent of figuring out how much gas an idle car consumes while parked. In such a state, energy will be used only to maintain vital organs, which include the heart, brain, kidneys, nervous system, intestines, liver, lungs, sex organs, muscles, and skin. For most people, upwards of ~70% of total energy (calories) burned each day is due to upkeep. Physical activity makes up ~20% of expenditure and ~10% is used for the digestion of food, also known as thermogenesis. The BMR is measured under very restrictive circumstances while awake. An accurate BMR measurement requires that a person's sympathetic nervous system is inactive, which means the person must be completely rested. Basal metabolism is usually the largest component of a person's total caloric needs. The daily caloric need is the BMR value multiplied by a factor with a value between 1.2 and 1.9, depending on activity level. In most situations, the BMR is estimated with equations summarized from statistical data. The Harris-Benedict Equation was one of the earliest equations introduced. It was revised in 1984 to be more accurate and was used up until 1990, when the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation was introduced. The Mifflin-St Jeor Equation has been shown to be more accurate than the revised Harris-Benedict Equation. The Katch-McArdle Formula is slightly different in that it calculates resting daily energy expenditure (RDEE), which takes lean body mass into account, something that neither the Mifflin-St Jeor nor the Harris-Benedict Equation does. Of these equations, the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation is considered the most accurate equation for calculating BMR with the exception that the Katch-McArdle Formula can be more accurate for people who are leaner and know their body fat percentage. You can pick the equation to be used in the calculation by expanding the settings. The three equations used by the calculator are listed below: Mifflin-St Jeor Equation: For men: BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A + 5 For women: BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A - 161 Revised Harris-Benedict Equation: For men: BMR = 13.397W + 4.799H - 5.677A + 88.362 For women: BMR = 9.247W + 3.098H - 4.330A + 447.593 Katch-McArdle Formula: BMR = 370 + 21.6(1 - F)W where: W is body weight in kg H is body height in cm A is age F is body fat in percentage BMR Variables Muscle Mass – Aerobic exercises, such as running or cycling, have no effect on BMR. However, anaerobic exercises, such as weight-lifting, indirectly lead to a higher BMR because they build muscle mass, increasing resting energy consumption. The more muscle mass in the physical composition of an individual, the higher the BMR required to sustain their body at a certain level. Age – The more elderly and limber an individual, the lower their BMR, or the lower the minimum caloric intake required to sustain the functioning of their organs at a certain level. Genetics – Hereditary traits passed down from ancestors influence BMR. Weather – Cold environments raise BMR because of the energy required to create a homeostatic body temperature. Likewise, too much external heat can raise BMR as the body expends energy to cool off internal organs. BMR increases approximately 7% for every increase of 1.36 degrees Fahrenheit in the body's internal temperature. Diet – Small, routinely dispersed meals increase BMR. On the other hand, starvation can reduce BMR by as much as 30%. Similar to a phone that goes into power-saving mode during the last 5% of its battery, a human body will make sacrifices such as energy levels, moods, upkeep of bodily physique, and brain functions in order to more efficiently utilize what little caloric energy is being used "

Related Body Fat Calculator | Calorie Calculator The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy needed while resting in a temperate environment when the digestive system is inactive. It is the equivalent of figuring out how much gas an idle car consumes while parked. In such a state, energy will be used only to maintain vital organs, which include the heart, brain, kidneys, nervous system, intestines, liver, lungs, sex organs, muscles, and skin. For most people, upwards of ~70% of total energy (calories) burned each day is due to upkeep. Physical activity makes up ~20% of expenditure and ~10% is used for the digestion of food, also known as thermogenesis. The BMR is measured under very restrictive circumstances while awake. An accurate BMR measurement requires that a person's sympathetic nervous system is inactive, which means the person must be completely rested. Basal metabolism is usually the largest component of a person's total caloric needs. The daily caloric need is the BMR value multiplied by a factor with a value between 1.2 and 1.9, depending on activity level. In most situations, the BMR is estimated with equations summarized from statistical data. The Harris-Benedict Equation was one of the earliest equations introduced. It was revised in 1984 to be more accurate and was used up until 1990, when the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation was introduced. The Mifflin-St Jeor Equation has been shown to be more accurate than the revised Harris-Benedict Equation. The Katch-McArdle Formula is slightly different in that it calculates resting daily energy expenditure (RDEE), which takes lean body mass into account, something that neither the Mifflin-St Jeor nor the Harris-Benedict Equation does. Of these equations, the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation is considered the most accurate equation for calculating BMR with the exception that the Katch-McArdle Formula can be more accurate for people who are leaner and know their body fat percentage.

But don't let that deter you from making lifestyle changes if you want to lose weight. There are a few ways to give your metabolism a boost. What is metabolism? Metabolism is the process through which your body converts what you eat and drink into energy. This complex process powers everything you do, from breathing, to growing, to providing your brain with the energy to think. The body burns calories (a measure of energy) all the time, whether your body is active or at rest: Basic body functions: Even when you're resting or sleeping, your body needs energy to keep vital functions going, like breathing, circulating blood, and repairing cells. This energy use is called your basal metabolic rate (BMR). Daily activities: Moving around, walking, talking, and doing everyday tasks also burn calories. Exercise: Physical activities like running, swimming, or lifting weights increase the number of calories your body uses. Metabolism is largely influenced by genetics. But there are some lifestyle modifications you can make that may help increase your metabolism. A key reason someone may want to boost their metabolism is because of the role metabolism plays in weight loss . Weight loss occurs when the body burns more calories than it consumes. Someone with a higher metabolic rate will burn more calories both at rest and during activity than someone with a lower (or slower) metabolic rate. Diet and metabolism Many people diet or follow restrictive diets to lose weight. But restrictive diets can sometimes backfire by slowing down your metabolism. That's because your body slows down your BMR, burning fewer calories over time, when it interprets reduced calorie intake as a threat of starvation. This is one reason why losing weight can often be difficult. So how can you choose foods that will boost, rather than slow, your metabolism? Research has found that certain foods can affect diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT), which may boost resting metabolic rate. Foods that may have this effect include: Protein . Healthy sources of protein include lean chicken, fish, beans, Greek yogurt, edamame, nuts, chia seeds, and low-fat cottage cheese. Unrefined carbohydrates. Fiber-rich foods that aren't highly processed can increase energy expenditure because they take longer to digest. Examples include vegetables, fruits, whole-grain breads, brown rice, and legumes. Caffeine. An 8-ounce cup of coffee contains about 100 milligrams (mg) of caffeine, while an 8-ounce cup of black tea contains about 50 mg. Green tea. Green tea contains about 25 mg of caffeine per each 8-ounce cup. Drinking about three cups of green tea a day can help you burn around 100 extra calories daily. DIT is higher in the morning and lower in the evening. Eating larger meals earlier in the day might help you burn more calories. While losing weight requires burning more calories than you consume, your body still needs sufficient fuel and nutrients to function properly. Instead of simply eating less, it's better to focus on consuming nutritious foods and increasing your physical activity. Should you build more muscle to enhance metabolism"

Subscribe Nutrition Evidence Based 8 Ways That May Speed Up Your Metabolism Medically reviewed by Marie Lorraine Johnson MS, RD, CPT — Written by Helen West, RD — Updated on January 11, 2024 Eat protein Do HIIT Try lifting Stand up Drink tea Eat spicy foods Sleep more Drink coffee FAQ Bottom line There are several easy and effective ways to support your metabolism, many of which involve making simple changes to your diet and lifestyle. Your metabolism is responsible for converting nutrients from the foods you eat into fuel. This provides your body with the energy it needs to breathe, move, digest food, circulate blood, and repair damaged tissues and cells. However, the word “metabolism” is also used to describe your basal metabolic rate (the number of calories you burn at rest). The higher your metabolic rate, the more calories you burn at rest. Many factors can affect your metabolism, including your age, diet, body composition, sex, body size, physical activity, health status, and any medications you’re taking. There are several evidence-based strategies that can help increase your metabolism to support weight management and overall health. Here are 8 easy ways to increase your metabolism. 1. Eat plenty of protein at every meal Eating food can temporarily increase your metabolism for a few hours. This is called the thermic effect of food (TEF). It’s caused by the extra calories required to digest, absorb, and process the nutrients in your meal. Protein causes the largest rise in TEF. Dietary protein requires 20-30% of its usable energy to be expended for metabolism, compared to 5-10% for carbs and 0-3% percent for fats. Eating more protein can also reduce the drop in metabolism often associated with losing fat. This is because protein helps prevent muscle loss, which is a common side effect of dieting. Summary Eating more protein can boost your metabolism so that you burn more calories. 2. Do a high-intensity workout High-intensity interval training (HIIT ) involves quick and very intense bursts of activity. If this type of exercise is safe for you, it can help indirectly speed up your metabolism. Your muscle cells will burn energy at rest, which helps you burn fat and build muscle.
